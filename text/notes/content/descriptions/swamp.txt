Murky water lies still and stagnant.
Twisted trees rise from the dark water.
The stench of decay hangs heavy in the air.
Fog drifts between the rotting stumps.
Something unseen splashes in the distance.
Treacherous mud threatens to swallow the unwary.
Insects swarm in thick clouds.
Dead branches reach out like grasping hands.
