Clear water reflects the sky like a mirror.
Lily pads float on the still surface.
Fish leap and splash near the shore.
Reeds sway gently at the water's edge.
The lake is deep and cold.
A light breeze creates gentle ripples.
The far shore shimmers in the distance.
Dragonflies hover above the glassy water.
