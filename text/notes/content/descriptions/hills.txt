Rolling slopes stretch out in all directions.
Heather and bracken cover the rounded hillsides.
A rocky outcropping provides a sweeping view.
Sheep trails wind between the grassy mounds.
The wind is stronger here, gusting between the rises.
Boulders dot the hillside like sleeping giants.
A small stream tumbles down the slope.
The path climbs steadily upward.
