Ancient trees tower overhead, blocking out the sun.
The forest floor is carpeted with fallen leaves.
Shafts of light pierce the dense canopy.
Moss covers every surface in emerald green.
The air is thick with the scent of pine.
Birdsong echoes through the shadowy depths.
Gnarled roots create treacherous footing.
A tangle of undergrowth blocks easy passage.
