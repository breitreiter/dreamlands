Dry brush and thorns dominate the landscape.
The earth is cracked and parched.
Hardy shrubs cling to life in the poor soil.
Dust devils swirl across the barren ground.
The sun beats down mercilessly.
Sharp stones and prickly plants make travel slow.
A few stubborn weeds push through the hardpan.
The land has a desperate, thirsty look.
