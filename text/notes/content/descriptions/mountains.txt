Jagged peaks scrape against the sky.
Snow clings to the highest reaches.
The air is thin and bitterly cold.
Sheer cliffs drop away into misty depths.
A treacherous scree slope blocks the way.
Wind howls through narrow passes.
Ice-covered rocks glitter in the sunlight.
The path clings to a narrow ledge.
