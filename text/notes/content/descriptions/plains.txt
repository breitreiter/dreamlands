Tall grass sways in the gentle breeze.
A sea of golden wheat stretches to the horizon.
Wildflowers dot the open meadow.
The land lies flat and featureless under an endless sky.
Crickets chirp in the knee-high grass.
A lone tree provides the only shade for miles.
The earth is soft and dark, rich with promise.
Wind creates rippling waves across the grassland.
