# Core Principles
Not all paths are equal, and that's fine. Some choices lead to richer lore, better rewards, or more satisfying narrative resolutions. Others lead to quick exits, painful lessons, or anticlimax. We don't balance outcomes - we make them plausible.

Contradictions are features, not bugs. Different players may leave the same encounter with incompatible understandings of what happened. One player fights the Brides and experiences them as hostile spirits. Another talks to them and learns they're tragic victims. Both are true from those perspectives. The world doesn't have one canonical story - it has the story you experienced.

Adversity is content. Getting your ass kicked, fleeing in terror, making the "wrong" choice - these create memorable stories. Not every encounter should be solvable. Not every situation should have a clean win state. Sometimes you leave empty-handed. Sometimes you limp away having learned that discretion beats valor.

Plausible choices, logical consequences. We offer options that make sense in context. We deliver outcomes that follow from those choices. If you draw steel on ghosts in a haunted cave, you might get wrecked. If you try to charm a wild animal, it might not work. The world responds to your actions, not to game balance.

# In Practice
- 3-4 choices per encounter (occasionally more if warranted)
- No "golden path" signaling
- No hand-holding or optimal choice hints
- Outcomes range from "rich and rewarding" to "well, you survived"
- Missing content is expected - play again, talk to other players, make different choices
