# Forest

## Identity

**Theme / Philosophy:**
The forest is defined by occlusion and authorship. It is not “wildness” so much as limited sight, hidden agency, and the uneasy sense that events are being shaped just beyond the edge of perception. Unlike the swamp (absorption), the plains (exposure), or the mesa (systemic order), the forest is intimate: sightlines are short, movement is ambiguous, and the canopy and undergrowth constrain both travel and awareness.

**Defining Contradiction:**
The forest is the only biome where a single human will can eclipse another. Elsewhere, the primary threat is environmental or systemic; here, the defining fear is that someone may be watching, and that your route may have been arranged for you. The horror is not nature, but authorship.

## The Land

**Terrain & Geography:**
The forest biome is represented on a 100×100 tile map (10,000 tiles total), with each tile approximately 4 miles across. Individual forest regions are named, contiguous clusters of forest tiles, typically ranging from roughly 3×3 to 8×8 tiles; multiple distinct regions may appear on a given map. The forest biome exhibits significant internal variation across and within regions.

Travel infrastructure varies by tier. In tier 1, roads are generally well maintained, though they may be intermittently obstructed by deadfall. In tier 2, there are only paths (animal trails and footpaths), with occasional fragments of old roads that have been overgrown and fallen into disrepair. In tier 3, there are no safe paths; routes that appear traversable may be trapped and function as misdirection for unwary travelers.

Biome adjacency is determined by map generation; any biome may border forest. There is no formal concept of transition tiles or transitional terrain.

**Weather & Seasonal Hazards:**
Forest weather trends damp with otherwise normal regional patterns (a temperate, rain-prone feel), but this is not guaranteed: because biome adjacency is determined by map generation, forest may appear next to dry terrain and should not be treated as uniformly wet. The campaign takes place over a few weeks in autumn immediately before the harvest, so long seasonal cycles are generally out of scope for play.

The forest does not rely on unique environmental hazards as a primary pressure. Difficulty instead escalates by tier: tier 1 problems are largely social and logistical; tier 2 emphasizes tense encounters, potential hostiles, and frightening moments in the wild; tier 3 is dominated by traps and misdirection, with routes functioning to herd travelers as hunted animals.

**Flora of Note:**
The forest includes typical temperate-forest vegetation: mixed stands of conifers and broadleaf trees, dense understory brush and saplings, ferns, mosses, and lichens. Fungal growth is common, ranging from edible varieties to rare specimens used as luxury food or processed into medicinal extracts; some preparations are also used as irritants or poisons. Plant materials are also harvested as practical inputs, including resin/pitch, tannin-rich bark, and dye-producing lichens and moss.

**Fauna of Note:**
The forest supports typical non-supernatural woodland fauna, including common game animals (e.g., deer and boar), small prey (e.g., rabbits), and predators (e.g., wolves and bears), alongside persistent pests such as biting insects and ticks. In tier 1, traffic on maintained roads supports the use of domestic draft and pack animals for hauling and travel; in tier 2, movement is limited to foot and animal paths and does not reliably support pack transport.

## Peoples

### Forest Folk

**Overview:**
Forest folk respect routine and distrust maps. They mark trees obsessively, say little about the deep wood, and do not romanticize the forest. They endure it.

**Settlement Names:**
Settlement names are short and blunt (e.g., Thornrun, Harth Glen, Brask, Redbark, Skell Hollow).

**Architecture:**
Architecture favors timber frames with bark left on the beams, moss-weighted shingles, sapling fences, and cabins that blend into undergrowth. Buildings are built to disappear, not to impress.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Forest folk dress plainly and functionally, with styles intentionally close to those of the plains. Work clothing is typically drab and undyed. Hunters are the main exception, commonly wearing greens. More saturated and decorative clothing is reserved for festivals and for being seen around town, which helps make deep-wood exiles read as visually out of place when encountered.

**Names:**
- *Given names:* Bram, Edda, Korrin, Tams, Soren
- *Surnames / epithets:* Skell, Thorn, Hale, Redleaf, Pike
- *Linguistic patterns:* Names are short and consonant-heavy, with a “woodcutter” rhythm (one to two syllables preferred). Surnames often derive from trees, tools, or terrain features.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Forest settlements are generally welcoming to merchants. Trade is active, and locals value both news and practical imports. Common interests include distinctive spices from the mesas and well-made iron tools from the mountains. Specific needs vary by settlement, and identifying those differences supports arbitrage-driven play. Hostility is more likely to follow ordinary breaches of social decorum than any special forest taboo. Forest folk may warn travelers about the deeper-wood exiles, typically describing them in hostile terms (e.g., bandits or cults).

**Proverbs:**
“Cut what you carry.” / “Paths change.” / “Don’t go where the canopy closes.”

### Deep Wood Exiles (Tier 2)

**Overview:**
Deep wood exiles are not villains; they are people who could not remain. They include plateau clan sons who refused blood-feuds, mesa clerks who falsified the wrong ledger, mountain deserters, debtors, lovers who ran, and Lattice defectors who asked the wrong question. They come from everywhere.

**Settlement Names:**
There are no formal settlements: only loose camps, with no flags and no shared banner beyond proximity.

**Architecture:**
Architecture is improvised: cabins built from scavenged beams, smoke carefully masked, and camps placed in hidden clearings with false trails leading nowhere.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Deep wood exiles tend to look mismatched at a glance. Individuals often arrive wearing the regional clothing they fled with and replace pieces only as they wear out; as a result, styles do not converge and may include civil or military uniforms (particularly among deserters). Over time, handmade items increasingly dominate as imported goods fail and are replaced with what can be produced or repaired locally. Hunters often attempt to blend in. Some “druids” adopt deliberately confrontational presentation—body dye, improvised regalia, and other displays that read as a warning rather than a uniform. Community recognition is local and personal: in small camps, unfamiliar faces are treated as outsiders, and outsiders are treated as potential threats.

**Names:**
- *Given names:* Mixed — drawn from every biome's naming conventions.
- *Surnames / epithets:* Often dropped or replaced. Many go by a single name or a descriptor.
- *Linguistic patterns:* No pattern. That's the tell — the names don't match each other or the locale.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Distrustful. Everyone is hiding from something, and everyone assumes you are too. They trade, they lie, and they keep watch.

### Relations Between Groups

Forest folk describe deep-wood exiles with fear and distrust, and this attitude is especially pronounced among children and those who do not travel far. In practice, relationships are more mixed: far-ranging hunters may know nearby camps and may even maintain friendships there. Some exiles can also pass as merchants and trade in nearby towns, creating limited and situational contact despite the prevailing suspicion.

There is no stable physical boundary between tier 1 and tier 2 forest regions under map generation. Instead, “deep wood” functions as an informal frontier concept: locals treat their immediate patch of forest as safe and tended, while assuming other regions deeper into the frontier are not. Exiles generally avoid establishing camps in two forest regions: the region inhabited by forest folk (who will drive them off) and the region dominated by the tier 3 hunter.

## Material Culture

**Weapons:**
Weapons in forest settlements skew toward tools and hunting implements. Common forest-side labels include the woodsman’s hatchet and woodsman’s axe, hunting knives, clubs, boar spears, and broad falchions. Bows, staves/cudgels, and slings are also common in the biome (especially among hunters), even where they are not reflected in settlement equipment lists.

**Armor:**
Forest armor is typically light and practical. Common labels include hunter’s leathers and bark-backed jerkins across quality tiers; heavier armor is not characteristic of the biome’s settlement market.

**Foods & Provisions:**
Forest foodways emphasize preserved game, river fish, nuts, and hardy travel carbs. Common vendor staples include venison jerky, smoked trout, dried rabbit, acorn bread, nut loaf, rye hardtack, wild berry preserve, maple candy, and hazelnut paste. Typical foraged foods include snared squirrel, brook minnows, wood grubs, acorns, wild onion, burdock root, blackberries, hazelnuts, and maple sap.

**Trade Goods:**
Trade goods vary by tier. Tier 1 commerce is legal, practical, and low-to-moderate value; tier 2 trade includes higher value-density materials and specialist goods associated with deep-wood camps and riskier collection.

- *Tier 1 (legal, practical):* resin/pitch tins; tannin bark bundles; dye lichens/moss cakes; charcoal; simple tar; common dried mushrooms; basic salves; tool handles and haft blanks.
- *Tier 2 (high value-density and specialist):* figured burls and knotwood pieces; tonewood billets; blackened “bogwood” chunks; amber-like resin beads/rough; rare dried mushrooms; medicinal extracts; irritants and poisons; sorted feathers and quills; deep-wood handcrafts (luck charms, sheath carvings/tool talismans, small statues, instrument parts).

**Consumables & Prevention Items:**
<!-- Biome-specific things players can buy to avoid or mitigate hazards. Antidotes, weather gear, talismans, bribes. These are the interesting preparation decisions. -->

## Distance Tiers

### Safe Zone

**Vibe:**
Working wood: managed, negotiated, and imperfectly owned. The defining concerns are boundaries and use.

**Tensions:**
Tensions include disputes over logging rights, old shrines swallowed by bark, missing game, and reversed trail markers. The main actors are woodcutters, charcoal burners, and trappers—people who use the forest and argue over who controls which parts of it.

**Typical Trouble:**
Typical trouble is practical, framed as a warning: “You shouldn’t have gone past that bend.”

### Wildlands

**Vibe:**
Refuge. This is where outcasts gather: smoke is masked, clearings are hidden, and false trails are laid. The dominant fear is social—everyone is hiding from something, and someone, somewhere, is looking for each of them.

**Defining Conflicts:**
The defining conflict is the cost of refuge: you lose reputation, protection, and sometimes your name, in exchange for space. The camps have no law—only proximity and mutual suspicion.

**Typical Trouble:**
Typical wildlands encounters center on uneasy contact and ambiguous threat. Common situations include meeting a lone exile; stumbling into a small exile camp; encountering a newcomer attempting to find a place among the camps; and finding another traveler (courier, merchant, pilgrim) who is lost, beaten, or actively being robbed. Violence is present but not constant, including ambushes by organized hunters and moments of pursuit or intimidation. Nonhuman danger appears as well, such as being stalked by wild animals. Some encounters foreground competing agendas, such as running into an outlander search party and choosing whether to direct them toward their quarry.

**Narrative Threads:**
Every exile has a story about why they ran and who might follow. These stories function as encounter seeds: a merchant passing through might carry news someone does not want carried, or be mistaken for a hunter sent to collect on old debts.

### Final Horror

**Vibe:**
No one goes here—not because of monsters, but because it is stupid. The forest is dense with snares, deadfalls, punji pits, and friction traps. Getting deeper is easy; getting out is hard. The forest slopes subtly inward. Sleep becomes difficult. Movement is constant, ambiguous, and often amounts to nothing—until it does not.

**The Horror Itself:**
There is one person. They are not insane or frenzied; they are disciplined, patient, and competent—a mirror of the player. Where you plan your load-out, they plan your route; where you prepare for threats, they prepare for your preparations. Their dwelling is austere and orderly: tools cleaned; topographic sketches, looped path diagrams, and annotations; tokens from previous hunts (a snapped compass, a bent insignia, a scorched journal page, a broken spur), each tagged, dated, and described in calm handwriting. You were not surviving; you were progressing through a curated experience. The horror is not death, but the realization that there was never an outside: you entered a narrative, mistook friction for chance, and hope was permitted to crest only so it could be extinguished at the perfect moment.

**Conflicts & Tensions:**
There is no factional politics in tier 3. The primary tension is systemic: traps and misdirection turn movement itself into conflict. The only meaningful “social” element is the possibility of encountering another traveler or victim. In the moment, such encounters can read as a tense respite—someone who warns you away, offers help, or simply confirms that you are not alone. Doubt about what that contact meant may emerge only afterward, once the experience is reinterpreted as authored.

**Typical Trouble:**
Tier 3 encounters are structured around denial of rest and denial of certainty. The player is pressured into errors through paranoia, exhaustion, and the occasional moment of lowered guard. The hunter is never confronted directly; their presence is experienced through a landscape that becomes systematically hostile and increasingly “authored.”

**Rewards & Temptations:**
Few enter tier 3 voluntarily. Those who do are typically described as mad adventurers or as people so violent or unmoored that even the exiles will not take them in. The stated motives are rarely material: proof of bravery or bushcraft; vengeance for a friend or family member; and the desire to identify who is killing people in the forest. Beyond these, the primary temptation is curiosity about what lies at the center of a forbidden place. The possibility of learning something is part of the lure, but it is not treated as survivable knowledge—those who “find out” are not expected to leave with it.

**Area-Specific Encounters:**
Encounters unique to tier 3 primarily take the form of authored environmental systems rather than discrete opponents:

- **Route manipulation:** paths that subtly loop, rejoin, or “solve” into dead ends; landmarks that recur out of order.
- **Marker sabotage:** trail signs, blazes, and makeshift cairns that are altered, reversed, or placed to lure travelers off safe ground.
- **Trap saturation:** obvious traps that force detours, plus concealed traps placed where detours predictably funnel you (snares, deadfalls, punji pits, friction traps).
- **Forced fatigue choices:** campsites that appear safe but are exposed, constrained, or designed to be abandoned; nights interrupted by repeated false alarms.
- **Supply pressure:** spoilage, loss, or theft of tools and provisions without clear sight of a perpetrator, escalating urgency and risk-taking.
- **Staged near-misses:** evidence that you were observed and spared at moments calculated to increase fear rather than resolve it.
- **Escalating misdirection:** “helpful” traces (tracks, discarded items, tidy clearings) that read as guidance but function as herding.

**Named NPCs:**
