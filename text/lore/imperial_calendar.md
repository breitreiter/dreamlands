# The Aldgate Reckoning
## Date format
A date is written as: **day month, year of the reign** — e.g., *14 Hayward, 22nd of Leopold III*. 

Military and bureaucratic usage sometimes adds the day-name: *Hammerday, 14 Hayward, 22nd of Leopold III*.

## The Months

Each month is 30 days, divided into five weeks of six days each.

## The Week

The Imperial week is six days, with the following names:

1. **Crownday** The first day. Formally the day of public authority — courts sit, proclamations are read, duties are collected.
2. **Turnday** A working day. Named for the lathe — originally a craftsman's day, now simply the second day of labor.
3. **Midmark** The middle of the week. Half-day markets are traditional in many cities.
4. **Aldersday** A working day. 
5. **Hammerday** The last full working day. Named for forge-work. Heavy labor, deadlines, and finishing.
6. **Graceday** The day of rest. Religious observance, family meals, idleness. Working on Graceday is legal but mildly disreputable.

A common saying: *"Crown to Hammer, then God gets what's left."*

## The Hollow Days

The four (or five) days between the end of **Yearwane** and the start of the new year's **Hearthbound** sit outside the month-and-week structure. They are numbered rather than named:

- **First Hollow** — Traditionally a day of fasting and reflection.
- **Second Hollow** — The *Settling of Accounts*. Debts are formally closed or renewed.
- **Third Hollow** — The *Night of Lamps*. Lanterns and candles are lit in windows, doorways, and public squares. The most widely observed tradition across the Empire.
- **Fourth Hollow** — *Candlecroft*. The last night of the old year. Bonfires, drinking, and varying degrees of civic disorder.
- **Fifth Hollow (Long Dark)** — Added every eighth year. Considered unlucky. Government offices close. In some colonies, it is a day of licensed misrule.

The Hollows are technically outside civil time — no interest accrues, no contracts take effect, and legal proceedings are suspended. In practice, this is honored inconsistently.
