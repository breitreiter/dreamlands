# [BIOME NAME]

## Identity

**Theme / Philosophy:**
<!-- The one-paragraph soul of this place. What is it *about*? What does it feel like to be here? What's the Conan-era analogue or touchstone? -->

**Defining Contradiction:**
<!-- Every interesting place has a tension at its core. Lush but poisonous. Wealthy but crumbling. Hospitable people in an inhospitable land. -->

---

## The Land

**Terrain & Geography:**
<!-- Broad strokes. What does the hex map look like? What are the dominant landforms? -->

**Weather & Seasonal Hazards:**
<!-- What do players need to *prepare for*? This drives gear and consumable decisions. -->

**Flora of Note:**
<!-- Plants that matter mechanically or narratively. Medicinal, poisonous, trade-relevant, or just atmospheric. -->

**Fauna of Note:**
<!-- Beasts of burden, predators, livestock, pests. What's on the road and what's in the stew? -->

**Landmarks & Ruins:**
<!-- Named places that appear on maps or get referenced in conversation. Anchors for plot keys. -->

---

## Peoples

### [CULTURE A]

**Overview:**
<!-- Who are they? What's their deal in two sentences? -->

**Settlement Names:**
<!-- What do they call their towns/villages? Naming conventions and a few examples. -->

**Architecture:**
<!-- What does the player see walking in? Materials, scale, distinctive features. -->

**Clothing & Appearance:**
<!-- What do NPCs look like? What signals status, profession, or allegiance? -->

**Names:**
- *Given names:*
- *Surnames / epithets:*
- *Linguistic patterns:* <!-- Phonetic tendencies, syllable structure, vowel preferences, consonant clusters. Enough for an LLM to generate plausible new names. -->

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
<!-- Welcoming? Suspicious? Exploitative? What does trade look like here? -->

---

### [CULTURE B]

<!-- Repeat structure above. -->

---

### Relations Between Groups

<!-- Who trades with whom? Who fights? Where do territories overlap and why does that matter to a merchant passing through? -->

---

## Material Culture

**Weapons:**
<!-- What's common, what's prized, what's improvised. Tie to cultural groups where relevant. -->

**Armor:**
<!-- Same. What does a typical guard wear vs. a wilderness hunter vs. a wealthy caravan master? -->

**Foods & Provisions:**
<!-- What's available in settlements? What's trail food? What's a luxury? This feeds directly into the provisions system. -->

**Trade Goods:**
<!-- What does this biome *produce* and what does it *hunger for*? Raw materials, crafted specialties, contraband. Drives the economic layer. -->

**Consumables & Prevention Items:**
<!-- Biome-specific things players can buy to avoid or mitigate hazards. Antidotes, weather gear, talismans, bribes. These are the interesting preparation decisions. -->

---

## Distance Tiers

### Safe Zone

**Vibe:**
<!-- One or two sentences. What's the feeling of traveling near settlements? -->

**Tensions:**
<!-- Low-stakes stuff. Petty conflicts, tolls, gossip, minor annoyances. The "normal world" the player leaves behind. -->

**Typical Trouble:**
<!-- Brief list. These encounters should be social, economic, or mildly inconvenient rather than dangerous. -->

---

### Wildlands

**Vibe:**
<!-- The mood shifts. What changes? What's the sound, the light, the smell? -->

**Defining Conflicts:**
<!-- What forces are at work out here? Territorial disputes, predator ranges, bandit economics, environmental pressure. -->

**Typical Trouble:**
<!-- The meat of the game. Encounters that test preparation and force hard choices. -->

**Narrative Threads:**
<!-- Recurring elements, unresolved situations, or slow-burn stories that encounters can reference. Seeds for plot keys. -->

---

### Final Horror

**Vibe:**
<!-- Go hard. What makes this place *wrong*? What's the atmosphere? -->

**The Horror Itself:**
<!-- What is the central threat or presence? This doesn't have to be a single monster — it can be a condition, a history, an ongoing event. -->

**Conflicts & Tensions:**
<!-- What's happening out here beyond survival? Factions, remnants, things with agendas. -->

**Typical Trouble:**
<!-- Encounters should feel desperate, strange, or revelatory. The type 2 fun dial is at maximum. -->

**Rewards & Temptations:**
<!-- Why would anyone come here? What's the trade goods jackpot, the lost knowledge, the thing that makes the risk calculable? -->

---

## Encounter Flavor

**Universal Modifiers:**
<!-- Biome-specific flavor that can be layered onto generic encounter templates. Weather, lighting, sounds, smells. The texture that makes "you encounter bandits" feel different here than anywhere else. -->

**Biome-Specific Encounters:**
<!-- Encounters that *only* make sense here. Unique to the land, the people, or the horror. -->

**Recurring NPCs or Archetypes:**
<!-- Character types the player might meet repeatedly. The grizzled trapper, the displaced merchant, the zealot heading into the horror zone. -->

---

## Plot Keys

<!-- Evocative fragments seeded with a delicate touch. Names, objects, phrases, or events that encounters can reference without explaining. List them with brief internal notes on what they *actually* mean, for authorial reference only. -->

| Key | Surface Read | Actual Significance |
|-----|-------------|---------------------|
|     |             |                     |

---

## Open Questions

<!-- Things still unresolved. Design debt. "I need to figure out how X works." Future you will thank present you. -->
