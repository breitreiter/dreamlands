# Plains

## Identity

**Theme / Philosophy:**
The plains biome is about the violence of scale and the way power changes character as it grows. Aldgate exists because the empire is large enough that conquering and settling this grassland did not register as a defining war but as an administrative decision. To the people who lived here before, the arrival of the empire was catastrophic and mythic; to the empire, it was a line item in a ledger. As scale increases, violence becomes procedural rather than personal, and expansion becomes indistinguishable from development. What feels like history to those on the receiving end feels like logistics to those who command the system.

**Defining Contradiction:**
The central tension of the plains is the mismatch between human experience and systemic indifference. Imperial soldiers in the mid-plains believed they were fighting a meaningful war, holding ground and sacrificing themselves against a deliberate enemy, when in reality they were colliding with an automated perimeter that did not recognize them as opponents. The abandoned city in the far plains sharpens this contradiction: the machines that shattered an army are not rival weapons but unattended safeguards, still enforcing boundaries around a home whose owners quietly left. The empire interpreted resistance as opposition and valorized it as conflict, but there was no adversary making choices on the other side. The plains reveal that at sufficient scale, systems do not need to hate you, defeat you, or even notice you in order to destroy you.

## The Land

**Terrain & Geography:**
Rolling grassland and cultivated land. The heartland is a patchwork of fields, hedgerows, and straight roads—legible, surveyed, organized in rows. Elevation is gentle; sight lines are long. As you move toward the wildlands, cultivation thins and imperial infrastructure appears: roads still straight, but flanked by forts, signal towers, and depots instead of farmsteads. Farther out, the same open terrain becomes empty: the same visibility that made the land easy to control now means there is nowhere to hide from the grid. Dominant landforms are human-made—roads, canals, boundary ditches—rather than dramatic natural features. The map feels flat, rational, and exposed.

**Weather & Seasonal Hazards:**
Temperate grassland climate. Summers are hot and dry with little shade; winters are cold and wet. Exposure is the main hazard: no forest canopy, so sun, wind, and rain hit directly. In the heartland, travelers prepare for long days in open country (sun, thirst, dust on dry roads). In the wildlands, the same exposure plus abandoned ground means fewer waystations and less shelter. Spring and autumn bring mud—roads and fields turn heavy, slowing travel and trade. Frost and fog can obscure the featureless terrain and make navigation by landmark difficult. No single catastrophic weather; the plains punish unpreparedness through accumulation (dehydration, exhaustion, cold) rather than sudden disaster.

**Flora of Note:**
Cultivated grain dominates the heartland—wheat, barley, rye—plus pasture grasses and hedgerow scrub. Hedgerows mark boundaries and provide scant cover; they yield nothing dramatic but reinforce the sense of ordered landscape. Wildflowers and hardy herbs appear in uncultivated margins; a few have minor medicinal or culinary use (chamomile, yarrow, wild garlic), but the plains are not a foraging biome—they are a breadbasket. As you move into the wildlands, cultivation gives way to rank grass, thistles, and volunteer grain in abandoned fields. Nothing poisonous or mythic; the flora is utilitarian and human-shaped.

**Fauna of Note:**
Livestock in the heartland: cattle, sheep, pigs, and draft animals (oxen, horses). These are the empire's wealth—taxed, counted, and traded. Pigeons, rats, and mice are ubiquitous in settlements and granaries. On the road, travelers may see hares, ground-nesting birds, and the occasional deer at the margins. In the wildlands, scavenger species increase—carrion birds, feral dogs—and predators (wolves, wild boar) are rumored at the far edges, though most soldiers never saw anything worse than rats and crows. No exotic or mythic beasts; the fauna is workaday. What's in the stew is grain, preserved meat, and whatever was in the larder.

**Landmarks & Ruins:**
Heartland landmarks are settlements and their institutions: Bramfield, Easthollow, Merewick, and the rest; church spires; market crosses; boundary stones and survey markers. In the wildlands, landmarks are imperial residue: Fort Redbank, Signal Post Eight, Westward Bastion, Harrow Line, Grainway Station, Forward Depot Three, the Old Survey Road, Dunfield Watch. These are wayfinding anchors—and contested territory. Deeper in, abandoned positions and overgrown artillery pits; finally, the abandoned city itself, which is the only landmark that matters in tier 3. No ancient ruins or mythic sites in the current notes; the plains' past is imperial and recent.

## Peoples

### Heartland Settlers (Tier 1)

**Overview:**
Agrarian society and contract law. Dense human presence. People here believe in trade, incremental improvement, civic duty, and stability. No one doubts the system; they argue about their position in it. They argue politely. They keep receipts. They expect the empire to function.

**Settlement Names:**
Aldgate-adjacent archaic British style. Examples: Bramfield, Easthollow, Merewick, Harthcombe, Dunlow Barrow, Westfold Tithing, Cresswell Vale, Longmere.

**Architecture:**
Timber-frame and stone, thatch or clay tile roofs. Low and practical—barns, storehouses, cottages, and the occasional larger hall for a prosperous family or guild. The church is the focal point: stone tower or spire, visible from the fields. Market squares are open, with a cross or well at the center. Wooden fences and hedgerows define boundaries; there are no walls around heartland settlements—this is safe country. Buildings are built to last but not to impress; the aesthetic is orderly, familiar, and legible. Ledgers and ink belong in the counting-house, the bailiff's office, or the merchant's booth by the market.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Wool and linen in practical cuts—tunics, breeches, aprons for labor. Earth tones and undyed cloth for common folk; better dye and finer weave for merchants and officials. Status shows in the quality of cloth, the presence of a proper coat or hat, and whether hands are callused or ink-stained. Bailiffs and minor functionaries wear something that signals office without being uniform—a badge, a particular cut. Church and civic duty are visible in small ways: clean hands, maintained gear. No one is armed to the teeth; a knife or staff is normal, a sword is for someone with a reason. The overall impression is tidy, modest, and busy.

**Names:**
- *Given names (men):* Osric, Thomlin, Bertram, Aldous, Edric, Wymond
- *Given names (women):* Maud, Elswyth, Joan, Catrin, Winifred, Agnes
- *Surnames / epithets:* Hale, Ward, Gower, Fenrick, Mallory, Pike, Harrow, Loxley, Mere
- *Linguistic patterns:* Vaguely archaic British. Full names are Given + Surname (e.g., Osric Hale, Maud Harrow).

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Trade is central. Conflicts are small-scale but real: merchant leverage, grain weights, inheritance disputes, disagreements about imperial policy. Merchants operate in a world of ledgers and ink where civic duty and stability are assumed.

---

### Frontier Remnants (Tier 2)

**Overview:**
There are no towns in the wildlands. Only outposts barely functioning, rag-tag patrols, affable scavenger bands, and ex-soldiers who never rejoined civilian life. Order has become extractive—this is the failed campaign zone. The empire built forts, signal towers, supply depots, and roadworks, then retreated. What remains is skeletonized infrastructure, half-collapsed garrisons, dug-in artillery pits, and watchfires never relit. The tone is brittle. Everyone is defensive. Everyone believes the land still belongs to someone.

**Military patrols** still hold some forts. They are the outcome of tepid half-measures to retake the farther plains. The empire rotates out a few platoons each spring; the current crop has been here half a year. Some are true believers who think they are the tip of the spear and will ride into glorious battle someday, or officers who want to make a name for themselves on the valor of their men. Most are just doing a tour of duty—they want to stay in the fort, play card games, avoid provoking a fight, and make it home alive. They insist you shouldn't be here but won't explain why. They are embarrassed, under orders, and still technically guarding nothing. They resent scavengers because that's imperial property, their grandfather is out here somewhere, and the campaign wasn't "a mistake."

**Bandits** are not raiders. They are logisticians without a state, families squatting in depots, salvagers with territory claims. They hate theft because "that's our scrap." They operate like guilds, not marauders. They don't want beef with the military. They are not heroes. They squat in abandoned forts and outposts; they pick salvage from the battlefields and carry it back to trade.

**Settlement Names:**
More utilitarian and functional. Examples: Fort Redbank, Signal Post Eight, Westward Bastion, Harrow Line, Grainway Station, Forward Depot Three, The Old Survey Road, Dunfield Watch.

**Architecture:**
Imperial standard-issue where the military still holds: pale stone or timber barracks, signal towers, depots with large doors for supply wagons. Geometric, functional, and slightly shabby—maintenance is deferred. But the fortifications bear the marks of terrible violence. Walls are cratered or blown open; stone is melted or vitrified in ways that no siege engine or fire could explain; whole sections are dead—corroded, blighted, or strangely scored, as if struck by something that left no ordinary ash. To a PC from a late medieval world, this damage has no familiar frame. Explosive shells, poison gas, and high-energy beam weapons produce effects that look apocalyptic and mythic: the work of dragons, wizards, or gods. The empire's soldiers fought something that could do *that* to stone and earth—and the empire has never quite said what it was. Where the empire has left, the same structures are half-collapsed, patched with salvage, or repurposed. Scavengers reinforce walls with rubble and scrap; doors hang wrong; roofs have fallen in. Artillery pits and dug-in positions remain as earthworks and debris. The player sees the skeleton of imperial order—clean lines under decay, under violence that beggars belief—and the improvisation of people who are not supposed to be there. Nothing ornamental; everything was built to a spec that no longer has a budget, and then something else happened to it.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Military personnel wear faded uniform—tunics, kit, insignia that have seen a long season. Mixed and mended; some pieces are salvaged or civilian. They look like soldiers who have been told to hold ground without being told why. Scavengers dress in practical salvage—army surplus, patched leather, whatever keeps the weather out. No uniform; the effect is motley but purposeful. Both groups are armed and visibly so—this is contested ground. Status among scavengers is signaled by who has first claim on territory or salvage, not by fine cloth. Status among military is rank and wear: the officer's coat is a bit better kept; the quartermaster has the keys.

**Names:**
- *Bandit leaders:* Garrick Vale, "Old" Merrin Quade, Tob Ashford, Halwick Dunn, Rourke Fenn
- *Military remnants:* Captain Ivor Strake, Sergeant Wyll Cade, Quartermaster Renold Pike, Lieutenant Bram Elcott
- *Linguistic patterns:* Everything sounds half-official.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Scavengers trade salvage; they have territory and operate like guilds. Military personnel are under orders and defensive. Neither group is oriented toward welcoming merchant traffic—the frontier is contested and brittle.

### Relations Between Groups

Heartland settlers expect the empire to function and argue about their position within it. Frontier military remnants are embarrassed by their role—guarding nothing, unable to explain why you shouldn't be here—and resent scavengers who treat imperial property as scrap. Scavengers do not want conflict with the military; they are logisticians and salvagers with territory claims, not marauders. Everyone in tier 2 is defensive and believes the land still belongs to someone. The empire has retreated from the wildlands but has not formally abandoned its claim; the result is a fractured social ecology with no towns, only outposts, patrols, and scavenger bands.

---

## Material Culture

**Weapons:**
Heartland: tools that can serve as weapons—billhooks, staves, knives. Bailiffs and guards may carry short swords or cudgels; nothing ornate. The aesthetic is practical and legal (you're allowed to defend yourself; you're not allowed to look like an invader). Wildlands: military issue—short swords, spears, crossbows—faded and salvaged. Scavengers carry the same, plus improvised picks and crowbars for salvage work. No one prizes exotic weapons; the plains are about order and salvage, not heirlooms. Fine weapons would be officer's sword or pre-retreat surplus, rare and functional rather than decorative.

**Armor:**
Heartland: leather, quilted jack, or nothing for most people. A guard or bailiff might wear a brigandine or mail shirt; wealthy caravan masters favor something that signals status without looking military—good leather, a reinforced coat. Wildlands: salvaged and mixed. Military personnel have standard-issue kit—cuirass, helmet, greaves—worn and patched. Scavengers wear whatever they've pulled from the dead or from depots: mismatched pieces, no full harness. No one in the plains is running around in plate; the tone is utilitarian and worn.

**Foods & Provisions:**
Heartland settlements run on grain: bread, porridge, beer. Preserved meat (salt pork, dried beef), cheese, root vegetables, and pulses. Market staples: loaves, wheels of cheese, sausages, ale. Trail food for merchants: hardtack, dried meat, grain in a sack, maybe a small cheese. Luxuries: white bread, spices (imported), good beer, fresh meat for a feast. The plains produce abundance in the heartland; the farther out you go, the more you rely on what you brought or what the military/scavengers have stockpiled. Wildlands provisions are army rations (boring, shelf-stable) or scavenger fare—same, but from abandoned depots.

**Trade Goods:**
The plains produce grain, flour, wool, leather, beer, preserved meat, and labor (draft animals, seasonal workers). Heartland trade is the engine: grain weights, tithes, and merchant leverage are the small-scale conflicts. The plains hunger for metal (tools, nails, weapons from mountain forges), salt, luxuries from other biomes, and—in the wildlands—anything that makes life in the failed campaign zone tolerable (medicine, warm gear, ammunition, information). Scavengers produce salvage: military surplus, scrap metal, abandoned equipment. They trade it back toward the heartland or to other scavenger bands; they don't produce food in quantity, so they need provisions.

**Consumables & Prevention Items:**
Exposure is the main hazard. Wide-brimmed hats or hoods, sun cover, and extra water for long days in open country. Cold-weather gear for winter and for nights in the wildlands where shelter is scarce. Maps and compass or landmark knowledge—the plains are featureless enough that getting lost is a real risk once you're off the main roads. In the wildlands, nothing special beyond what you'd carry for contested territory (first aid, rations). For tier 3, there are no established consumables that mitigate the grid or golems; preparation is about knowing the triggers (density, weapons, heat, boundaries) and avoiding them, or accepting the risk.

## Distance Tiers

### Safe Zone

**Vibe:**
Warm wind. Golden fields. Wooden fences. Church bells. Ledgers and ink. Order is beneficial, mostly fair, occasionally frustrating. This is agriculture and contract law. People believe in trade, incremental improvement, civic duty, and stability.

**Tensions:**
Conflicts are small-scale but real: merchant leverage, grain weights, inheritance disputes, disagreements about imperial policy. No one doubts the system; they just argue about their position in it.

**Typical Trouble:**
Disputes over grain weights or measures; being asked to witness a contract or testify to a handshake deal; inheritance quarrels that spill into the market; toll or tithe collectors insisting on paperwork; a merchant undercutting a local and the resulting gossip; rumors about imperial policy (taxes, conscription, the campaign) that everyone has an opinion about; church or civic duty that requires a small contribution or attendance; lost livestock or disputed boundary that needs a neutral party. Social and economic friction, not violence—the system works, and the trouble is your position in it.

**Named NPCs:**
To be developed. Archetypes that fit: a bailiff or reeve who knows everyone and keeps the peace; a prominent merchant or guild factor; a priest or lay official tied to tithes and records. Use the established name list (Osric Hale, Maud Harrow, etc.) when naming.

**Plot Keys:**
| Key (exact) | Surface Read (what the player is told) | Semantic Contract (what it actually means) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (none yet)  | —                                      | To be defined during encounter design.      |

---

### Wildlands

**Vibe:**
The mood shifts. Order becomes extractive. This is the failed campaign zone. No towns—only outposts barely functioning, rag-tag patrols, affable scavenger bands, and ex-soldiers who never rejoined civilian life. The tone is brittle. Everyone is defensive. Everyone believes the land still belongs to someone.

**Defining Conflicts:**
Military patrols hold some forts and insist you shouldn't be here; they are under orders, embarrassed, and still technically guarding nothing. Scavenger bands operate like guilds—logisticians without a state, families squatting in depots, salvagers with territory claims. They resent theft ("that's our scrap") and do not want beef with the military. The empire has retreated; skeletonized infrastructure, half-collapsed garrisons, and abandoned supply depots define the landscape. Territory and ownership are contested and unresolved.

**Typical Trouble:**
A patrol demands papers or justification for being on the road; scavengers assert territory and want to know whose scrap you're near; finding an abandoned position—bodies, journals, or both—that raises questions about what happened here; being caught between a military checkpoint and a scavenger claim with no clean way through; discovering that someone else has already stripped the salvage you were told about; negotiating passage or trade with a band that doesn't want trouble but doesn't trust you; overhearing arguments about the campaign (it wasn't a mistake; their grandfather is out here) that reveal how brittle the loyalties are. Encounters should force choices about allegiance, risk, and what you're willing to do to get through.

**Narrative Threads:**
The empire rotates platoons each spring—the current crop has been here half a year, and the next rotation will either reinforce or withdraw. The campaign wasn't "a mistake" to those who believe in it; to others, it's a waste. Grandfather (or someone's kin) is out here somewhere—lost, dead, or never found. Salvage economy: who owns what, who had it first, and what gets traded back toward the heartland. The border between "we're still holding" and "we've been abandoned" is unclear; forts and depots exist in a state of half-occupation. Rumors about the far plains—the abandoned city, the things that still move there—filter back and are dismissed or feared depending on who's talking.

**Named NPCs:**
Bandit leaders: Garrick Vale, "Old" Merrin Quade, Tob Ashford, Halwick Dunn, Rourke Fenn. Military remnants: Captain Ivor Strake, Sergeant Wyll Cade, Quartermaster Renold Pike, Lieutenant Bram Elcott.

**Plot Keys:**
| Key (exact) | Surface Read (what the player is told) | Semantic Contract (what it actually means) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (none yet)  | —                                      | To be defined during encounter design.      |

### Final Horror

**Vibe:**
Order without humanity. No settlements. No civilians. No bandits. No patrols. Even the empire won't come here. This is not a battlefield. It is infrastructure. Quiet. Impersonal. Empty.

**The Horror Itself:**
An abandoned city—a mirror of Aldgate. Someone else's city on their frontier. The machines were there to protect the civilians. The civilians are gone, but the machines are still there. They defend nothing. The place is empty. Not destroyed. Not looted. Just vacated. Doors closed. Granaries empty. Market stalls intact. The empire ran the numbers and left it behind; it wasn't worth the cost to go out and deactivate the defense grid.

**The Grid** is not chaotic and not malicious. It activates based on density thresholds, weapon signatures, heat signatures, and boundary crossing. It does not chase beyond parameters. It enforces.

**Golems** are not mythic. They are part numbers. Designations like STN-4H, ARX-11, Pylon Unit R-9, Sentinel 7-C, Grid Marshal L-0, Obelisk Node V-12. No nicknames. No personality. When encountered, their identification is spoken or inscribed in crisp utilitarian script. They do not taunt. They do not roar. They announce operational states.

**Conflicts & Tensions:**
There are no human factions here. The tension is between the player and autonomous systems that enforce rules no one is left to benefit from. The grid activates. The golems announce. The city is intact and empty.

**Typical Trouble:**
Crossing a boundary or exceeding a density threshold and triggering the grid; encountering a golem that announces its designation and operational state before enforcing; entering the abandoned city and discovering which sectors are still live; finding intact workshops, sealed stores, or pre-evacuation goods and having to choose between taking them and avoiding activation; realizing the grid does not distinguish friend from foe—it only responds to triggers; discovering journals or records that explain why the civilians left (or that they didn't leave voluntarily); being forced to retreat or hide when a golem or grid response makes passage impossible. Encounters should feel desperate (you are not in control), strange (the logic is procedural, not human), and revelatory (you understand, too late, what the empire ran into).

**Rewards & Temptations:**
The city is empty but not looted—granaries are empty (evacuated or consumed), but market stalls are intact, doors are closed, and some spaces may still hold sealed goods, tools, or records. Why come here? Someone in tier 2 might pay for proof the city exists, or for a specific item (a map, a key, a family token). The desperate might be looking for a relative who never came back. The curious might want to understand what broke the campaign—what the empire's soldiers actually faced. Technically inclined parties might want to study the grid or the golems (a dangerous temptation). The reward is never safe; the grid and the golems make extraction the real challenge. The empire left because the cost of deactivation wasn't worth it—so whatever is left is either low-value or high-risk.

**Area-Specific Encounters:**
Grid activation: crossing a boundary, carrying weapons in a hot zone, or moving in a group that exceeds density triggers a response. The player must retreat, disperse, or abandon gear to avoid escalation. Golem contact: a unit (STN-4H, ARX-11, Pylon Unit R-9, etc.) announces itself in crisp utilitarian script and enforces—no dialogue, no negotiation. Entering the abandoned city: navigating empty streets, closed doors, intact but vacant buildings; deciding which sectors to risk. Finding a sector that is still "live" versus one that has been quiet long enough to be safe (or has it?). Evidence of the evacuation: left-behind possessions, half-finished tasks, records that hint at why they left and whether the grid was cause or effect. No encounters that depend on other biomes or mythic elements—the horror is local, procedural, and imperial.

**Named NPCs:**
To be developed. Tier 3 can support named figures only in retrospect: the last garrison commander, the surveyor who mapped the perimeter, the civilian who wrote the journal the player finds. Use these for rumors, journals, and referenced victims rather than living NPCs.

**Plot Keys:**
| Key (exact) | Surface Read (what the player is told) | Semantic Contract (what it actually means) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (none yet)  | —                                      | To be defined during encounter design.      |

## Open Questions

- Named NPCs for Safe Zone (bailiff, merchant, priest archetypes) and tier 3 (retrospective figures: last commander, surveyor, journal author)—to be filled when encounter design assigns names and roles.
- Plot keys for all tiers—to be defined when encounter design establishes set_key/check_key strings and semantic contracts.
- Hex map granularity: exact tile count or scale (e.g. 100×100 like scrub) if plains need to align with other biomes.
- Whether the abandoned city and the "someone else's frontier" have a proper name (in-world or design-only) for consistency in downstream text.
