# Mountain

## Identity

**Theme / Philosophy:**
The mountain is an examination of justice—specifically, the relationship between suffering and the institutions built to address it. Each tier of elevation represents a greater distance between the person who suffers and the person who acts on their behalf. The higher you climb, the more you can see, and the less any single person's pain weighs against the system's need to perpetuate itself. Altitude is abstraction. The air gets thinner and so does the connection to the grievance that started the climb.

**Defining Contradiction:**
Everyone in the mountains is motivated by justice, and each tier demonstrates a different way that justice fails—not through malice, but through distance. The miners' justice is immediate, relational, and righteous, but it can't see the system. The scholars' justice is principled and structural, but it spends individual lives cheaply in service of abstractions. The peak's justice is procedurally complete and functionally inert—a system so sophisticated it has replaced the thing it was built to do. The mountain's final horror is the possibility that some injustices are better left unresolved, because the resolution costs more than the crime. That idea would make the miners sick, the scholars suspect it but never say plainly, and the peak has internalized it so completely its inhabitants no longer recognize it as betrayal.

## The Land

**Terrain & Geography:**
Steep slopes, narrow valleys, and ridge lines. Settlement is vertical, not horizontal: paths zig-zag, rope-and-pulley lifts haul goods up inclines, and communities cling to the land in layers. Mining towns sit in the valleys where company-owned brick structures dominate; independent ridge families live higher, in timber houses on hollows and runs. Farther up, the terrain supports only remote institutions—monasteries, academies, observatories—built into the mountainside with thick walls and clean lines. The map reads as elevation and access: hollows, gaps, ridges, branches. Dominant landforms are the slopes themselves and the human response to them—switchbacks, lifts, and settlements that follow the contour.

**Weather & Seasonal Hazards:**
Cold increases with altitude. Wind in the hollows is constant; at the upper slopes and the peak, exposure and thin air are the main hazards. Travelers must prepare for long climbs, sudden drops in temperature, and passes that close in winter. Snow and ice make already steep paths treacherous. In the lowlands, rain turns paths to mud and can flood valley bottoms; in the high country, storms can strand parties for days. No single catastrophic weather pattern; the mountain punishes the unprepared through exposure, isolation, and the cost of moving goods (and people) up and down.

**Flora of Note:**
Hardwood on the slopes—enough for timber, charcoal burning, and the creaking repair culture of ridge settlements. Lower valleys may have pasture and kitchen gardens where the company or independent families tend a few crops. Nothing mythic or heavily medicinal in the notes; the flora supports labor and subsistence. At higher elevations, tree line gives way to scrub and alpine conditions—the scholars' institutions exist in a landscape that is increasingly bare and functional.

**Fauna of Note:**
Trappers and hunters suggest game in the backcountry—enough to support ridge families and supplement diet. Livestock in settled valleys where there is graze. No exotic or mythic beasts specified; the fauna is practical. What's in the stew is what was hunted, raised, or brought up from below.

**Landmarks & Ruins:**
Lowland landmarks are the mining settlements and ridge communities: Briar Run, Kestrel Hollow, Harrow Gap, Dane's Ridge, Lowwater Branch, Ashfall, Rook's Landing, High Ember, Willowcrest. Upper slopes are anchored by scholarly institutions and their locations: Hohrthal, Kaltbach, Steinmund, Grathalde, Weidmatt, Oberlamm, Dürrbühl, Felsgrund, Schattwald, Bleichhorn—and within them, the Lesehalle, the Stiftung, the Graue Bibliothek, the Druckwerk, the Turmschule, the Langarchiv. The peak's only landmark is the Stift: the granite core and the timber-framed growth around it, the tea houses, the Schreibstube, the Wegtafel, the Wandelgang. Old mine tunnels are said to "remember"; they function as rumor and superstition rather than mapped ruins.

## Peoples

### Mining Folk (Tier 1 — Lowlands and Approaches)

**Overview:**
Salt-of-the-earth working people—trappers, miners, charcoal burners. Appalachian-coded. Their moral world is relational: loyalty, kinship, community. They understand that the system is rigged in favor of mine owners in comfortable mansions in Aldgate, and they resent it in the abstract, but that resentment is cold compared to the heat of watching someone they love get hurt, get sick, or lose their home. Their anger is proportional to proximity. Justice, to them, is a guy named Bill getting what he's owed. They measure a person by: Do you show up when someone's roof collapses? Do you share when the mine closes? Do you sing at a wake? They do not trust law. They trust memory. Their strength is that they'll never abandon a neighbor. Their vulnerability is that this loyalty makes them exploitable—the system can hurt them one at a time and they'll never organize a structural response, only a series of personal ones.

**Settlement Names:**
Terrain-based and lived-in. Patterns: (Family Name)'s (Landform), or (Descriptor) + (Hollow/Run/Ridge). Two to three syllables; rhythm matters. Examples: Briar Run, Kestrel Hollow, Harrow Gap, Dane's Ridge, Lowwater Branch, Ashfall, Rook's Landing, High Ember, Willowcrest.

**Architecture:**
Narrow timber houses clinging to slopes; porches that overlook valleys; smokehouses and tool sheds leaning at angles; rope-and-pulley lifts for hauling goods up steep inclines. Wood dominates. Things creak. Everything has been repaired three times. In the valleys, company-owned brick structures—stark contrast to the ridge timber. Settlements are vertical; paths zig-zag. No stone fortresses; the aesthetic is weathered, practical, and human-scaled.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Practical and worn. Sturdy but not heavy. Nothing courtly or ornate. Status is signaled by who shows up for whom, not by fine cloth. Labor and weather shape what people wear. Visual identity: slate gray, weathered wood, coal black, autumn red.

**Names:**
- *Given names (men):* Arlen, Boone, Calder, Deke, Emory, Ferris, Gideon, Harlan, Jory, Keane, Larkin, Merrit, Nolan, Orrin, Pike, Roscoe, Silas, Tolan, Whit, Zeke. Nicknames matter: "Cal" for Calder, "Lan" for Harlan, "Gid" for Gideon, "Ro" for Roscoe.
- *Given names (women):* Ada, Brenna, Cora, Delia, Elowen, Faye, Hester, Iva, Junia, Keziah, Lenore, Maris, Norah, Odette, Pearl, Rilla, Tamsin, Verna, Willa, Zadie. Nicknames: "Dell" for Delia, "Rill" for Rilla, "Zee" for Zadie, "Tam" for Tamsin.
- *Surnames / epithets:* Terrain-based: Ridge, Holloway, Kestrel, Briar, Lowwater, Ashby, Crowell, Fenwick, Harrow, Latch, Boonefield. Labor-based: Pickard, Danner, Coalridge, Mercer, Fletch, Rafter, Tillman, Weaver, Dorr. Old family names (ridge dynasties): Ketter, Rowan, Talver, Bright, Crowder, Mallory, Vance, Hale, Durren.
- *Linguistic patterns:* Soft but clipped. Musical but weathered. Less "iron anvil," more "ridge wind." Names derived from terrain; multi-word settlement names common. Personal names become place names quickly.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Suspicious of outsiders, especially well-dressed ones. Quick to test you. The tension is between independent ridge families and company towns in the valleys—debt paid in scrip, strikes simmering. Trade exists but is colored by who you are and whose side you're on. Downlanders and valefolk are not automatically trusted.

---

### Scholars (Tier 2 — Upper Slopes)

**Overview:**
A strange inverse of the miners. They occupy remote institutions—monasteries, academies, observatories—and they see the whole system clearly. They get genuinely upset about abstract injustice: structural inequality, corrupt institutions, the mechanisms by which wealth is extracted from labor. But they view individual suffering with a kind of stoic detachment. Some sincerely want to help the miners. The problem is that their attachment to systemic thinking means they're willing to spend miners' lives cheaply if the result is a more just system. They think the miners are heartbreakingly short-sighted. The miners think the scholars are heartlessly detached. They are both correct. They're angry at the same things and they think they agree, until something happens and it's time to point fingers—and then the alliance collapses because one side says "they hurt my friend" and the other says "yes, but the system."

**Settlement Names:**
Swiss-German institutional style. Examples: Hohrthal, Kaltbach, Steinmund, Grathalde, Weidmatt, Oberlamm, Dürrbühl, Felsgrund, Schattwald, Bleichhorn.

**Architecture:**
Swiss-German institutional—austere, functional, quietly magnificent. Think the Abbey of Saint Gall: a library with perfect order, every book catalogued, built on a mountainside. Timber and stone. Clean lines. No ornamentation for its own sake; the precision is the beauty. Windows sized for reading light, not for showing off. Thick walls because the mountain demands it, and the thickness also means silence. These buildings say "we are serious about thinking and we do not need you to be impressed." Institution names: the Lesehalle (reading hall), Hohrkollegium (high collegium), the Stiftung (the foundation), Graue Bibliothek (grey library), Abendhaus (evening house), the Druckwerk (the printworks), Turmschule (tower school), Langarchiv (long archive).

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Not specified in the notes. Infer: austere, functional, consistent with institutional life—nothing flashy, nothing that would suggest wealth or fashion over purpose.

**Names:**
- *Given names (men):* Urs, Reto, Kaspar, Niklaus, Balz, Sepp, Jörg, Luzi, Beat, Thierry
- *Given names (women):* Margrit, Vreni, Regula, Dorli, Bettina, Seline, Anneli, Rosmarie, Lisbeth, Priska
- *Family names:* Amberg, Thalmann, Wenger, Buchser, Zurbriggen, Glatthard, Stalder, Felber, Grünwald, Mattli
- *Recurring character:* Regula Felber.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Scholars are oriented toward ideas and institutions, not trade. They may need supplies hauled up the mountain; they may engage in limited exchange. The disposition is likely neutral to slightly dismissive—merchants are part of the system they study, not peers in the life of the mind.

---

### Relations Between Groups

The miners and the scholars are angry at the same things and think they agree—until it's time to point fingers. The miners say "they hurt my friend"; the scholars say "yes, but the system." The alliance collapses because one side prioritizes relational justice and the other structural. The peak (the Stift) sits above both: petitioners from the lowlands and the upper slopes eventually find their way there, and the bureaucracy converts them into long-term residents who socialize with their adversaries. So the flow is: miners in the valleys and ridges, scholars in the institutions, and above them all a court that resolves nothing but keeps everyone engaged, comfortable, and present.

---

## Material Culture

**Weapons:**
Not specified in the notes. Infer from labor and setting: tools that can serve as weapons—picks, axes, knives. Miners and trappers carry what they use. Nothing ornate; the aesthetic is practical. Scholars are not defined by arms; if they have them, likely minimal—the institution is the authority.

**Armor:**
Not specified. Infer: leather, quilted, or minimal for laborers; nothing that suggests military or nobility. Scholars: unlikely to be armored; the mountain's conflict is institutional and moral, not martial in tier 1–2.

**Foods & Provisions:**
Valley and ridge: what can be grown, hunted, or brought up—game, preserved meat, root vegetables, grain where the land allows. Company towns: provisions controlled or rationed; scrip economy. Trail food for climbers: whatever keeps in the cold and can be carried. At the Stift, everything is hauled up at great expense—tea, bread, paper, cloth—and a small market square exists to serve delegates who stay for months. The tea houses and bakeries are the social and provisioning heart of the peak's domesticated layer.

**Trade Goods:**
The mountain produces mineral wealth (ore, coal), timber, charcoal, and labor. It hungers for metal goods (tools, nails), salt, luxuries from below, and—for the institutions—books, paper, ink, and the supplies that make remote scholarly life possible. The lowlands also hunger for justice that the system does not deliver; that hunger drives some to climb toward the Stift.

**Consumables & Prevention Items:**
Cold-weather gear, extra rations for long climbs, rope and climbing gear. At altitude, warmth and shelter. Nothing mythic specified; preparation is for the physical and social journey—and for the procedural maze of the Stift, where the only "consumable" might be patience and paper.

## Distance Tiers

### Safe Zone

**Vibe:**
Wind in the hollows. Timber and smoke. Kin and memory. This is the world of the mining folk—relational, loyal, suspicious of outsiders. You're measured by whether you show up when a roof collapses and whether you sing at a wake. Ledgers exist in the company offices; trust exists in the ridge.

**Tensions:**
Independent ridge families versus company towns. Debt paid in scrip. Strikes simmering. Moral gray conflicts: labor unrest, family versus company, who gets what when the mine closes. No one is the villain in their own story; everyone is motivated by survival and a kind of justice.

**Typical Trouble:**
Disputes over pay, scrip, or conditions; a neighbor's roof collapsed and the community is pulling together; being tested as an outsider (downlander, valefolk); delivering or withholding something that could tip a strike; inheritance or kinship quarrels that turn on who showed up when; company men versus ridge families over territory or water. Social and economic friction, with the ever-present sense that the system is rigged and the only thing you can count on is who stands with you.

**Named NPCs:**
Use the established name list (Arlen Ketter, Delia Harrow, Boone Lowwater, Norah Pickard, Silas Crowder, Ada Bright, Calder Vance, Keziah Rowan, Harlan Danner, Rilla Ashby, etc.). Specific named NPCs to be developed when encounter design assigns roles.

**Plot Keys:**
| Key (exact) | Surface Read (what the player is told) | Semantic Contract (what it actually means) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (none yet)  | —                                      | To be defined during encounter design.      |

### Wildlands

**Vibe:**
The mood shifts. You're in scholar country—remote institutions on the upper slopes. The architecture is austere and serious. The people here see the whole system and care about abstract injustice; they are less moved by the guy named Bill. The air is thinner. The alliance between miners and scholars is theoretical until something happens and it's time to point fingers.

**Defining Conflicts:**
Scholars want to fix the system and are willing to spend miners' lives cheaply for the cause. Miners want someone to show up when the roof collapses. When a crisis hits, one side says "they hurt my friend" and the other says "yes, but the system"—and the alliance collapses. The defining conflict is not violence but the failure of two kinds of justice to align.

**Typical Trouble:**
Being asked to carry a message, a petition, or a grievance between miners and scholars; discovering that a scholar's "help" has made things worse for a specific family; mediating (or being caught in) a dispute where both sides are right in their own frame; finding that the path to the Stift starts here—someone wants you to take their case up the mountain; labor unrest that the scholars interpret one way and the miners another. Encounters should force choices about whose justice you're serving and whether structural and relational justice can ever be the same thing.

**Narrative Threads:**
Strikes simmering; debt and scrip; family versus company; the miners' belief that the scholars are heartlessly detached; the scholars' belief that the miners are heartbreakingly short-sighted; the climb toward the Stift as the place where grievances go when mortal institutions fail—and where they go to be comforted into stasis.

**Named NPCs:**
Regula Felber (recurring scholar character). Others to be developed; use the established scholar name lists (Urs, Reto, Margrit, Vreni, etc.; Amberg, Thalmann, Felber, etc.).

**Plot Keys:**
| Key (exact) | Surface Read (what the player is told) | Semantic Contract (what it actually means) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| (none yet)  | —                                      | To be defined during encounter design.      |

### Final Horror

**Vibe:**
A court of cosmic authority where grievances that mortal institutions cannot resolve are brought for supernaturally binding judgment. It sounds like the ultimate recourse—the place where justice finally, definitively happens. The reality is an elegant, comfortable, interminable bureaucracy. Trial dates shift. Forms multiply. There is always progress, but it moves in circles. The granite halls are cavernous and cold; the light feels rationed. But nobody can live in a cathedral. So you shuttle between the space designed to make you feel the weight of justice and the tea houses designed to make you feel comfortable—and over time you spend more hours in the tea house than the hall.

**The Horror Itself:**
The Stift. Basically magic Hague on a mountain. The original Stift is granite—massive, old beyond reckoning. The halls where proceedings happen are cavernous, cold, lit by high narrow windows. The ceilings are too high. The benches are stone. When you first arrive, you feel exactly what you're supposed to feel: this is serious, this is ancient, this is bigger than you. Your grievance matters because this place is willing to hear it.

But the system is not broken. It works exactly well enough to keep everyone engaged, comfortable, and present. The endless delays are the mechanism by which adversaries are converted into peers. The bureaucracy is also a ceasefire. The comfortable dinners are also diplomacy. The frozen conflict is unjust, but it is stable. While petitioners wait, they socialize with their adversaries. Both sides are educated, charismatic, pragmatic. They take the long view. The incessant delays become a part-time job—a few hours of paperwork, a letter home about progress being made, then dinner with the people you came to prosecute. The mountain's final horror is the possibility that some injustices are better left unresolved, because the resolution costs more than the crime. The peak has internalized that so completely its inhabitants no longer recognize it as betrayal.

**Architecture of the Stift:**
Around the original granite core, a second Stift has grown. Timber-framed buildings lean against the stone walls like barnacles. Dormitories that started as austere cells have been gradually domesticated—a rug here, a writing desk there, personal effects accumulating because everyone's stay keeps getting extended. Some of the older dorms are basically apartments. You can tell how long someone's been at the Stift by how comfortable their room is. The commercial area grew organically: a tea house, then a bakery, then a stationer, then a tailor. A small market square exists at great expense—everything is hauled up the mountain. The tea houses are warm, well-lit, intimate—the opposite of the granite halls. The common dining hall is half-empty; long-timers eat at the tea houses, at private dinners, in each other's apartments. The Schreibstube—the writing room—is where righteous fury gets metabolized into procedure, one well-crafted document at a time. The Wegtafel is a massive board showing the procedural steps to resolution; it's beautiful, detailed, and incomprehensible. New arrivals study it; long-timers don't look at it anymore. Someone has probably hung their coat on it. The Wandelgang—covered walking galleries—is where adversaries first start talking. The architecture literally puts you on the same path. You can't pace a cloister with someone for three months without eventually saying hello.

**Conflicts & Tensions:**
There are no warring factions—yet. The tension is between the stability of the frozen injustice and the possibility of resolution. The PC functions as a Dying Earth protagonist—a catalyst, not a hero. They are the hammer that strikes the Prince Rupert's Drop: a glass bead under enormous internal tension, perfectly stable as long as the surface remains intact. The PC chips the tail—asks the wrong question, files the right form, actually reads a document nobody was supposed to read—and the whole thing detonates. The comfortable stasis collapses. Delegates who had become friends are suddenly adversaries again. Petitioners who wrote cheerful letters home must face years of accomplished nothing. Judges must actually rule, and someone must lose.

**Typical Trouble:**
Navigating the procedure—the Wegtafel, the Schreibstube, the endless filings; discovering that the common hall is half-empty because everyone has settled in; being invited to tea or dinner with the people you (or your patron) came to prosecute; finding that the tools for seeking justice are excellent and the act of filing is almost pleasurable, and that this is how fury becomes procedure; being offered the choice to leave well enough alone or to force a ruling—and understanding that forcing a ruling may make everything worse. Encounters should feel revelatory: you see how the machine works, and you see that it works by never quite finishing.

**Rewards & Temptations:**
Why would anyone come here? To get justice—or to believe that justice is possible. The temptation is to think that one more filing, one more hearing, will resolve the grievance. The reward for the PC who breaks the stasis is the satisfaction of having done the objectively righteous thing—and the horror of the final scene: the beautiful institutional halls collapse into warring factions. Blood, fire, screaming. The PC stands in the wreckage having exposed the hypocrisy, shattered the comfortable fraud, forced the unresolved grievance into the open. And the result is worse than the stasis. The frozen injustice was a betrayal of the miners. The resolved injustice is a catastrophe. Mirror structure with the forest: in the forest, the hunter's house shows the PC their reflection and says "you're more like this monster than you think." On the mountain, the burning hall shows the PC their handiwork and says "you're more like these hypocrites than you think, because you also believed justice would be clean."

**Area-Specific Encounters:**
The Schreibstube—drafting filings, appeals, letters home; the system wants you to engage; the tools are excellent. The Wegtafel—studying the procedure, or ignoring it. The Wandelgang—walking with adversaries who have become companions. The common hall—half-empty, transitional; where is everyone? Tea houses and private dinners—the real socializing. The granite hall—the hearing that keeps being delayed. The moment of choice: file the form that forces a ruling, or leave the ceasefire in place. The detonation: stasis collapses, factions war, the PC sees what "fixed" looks like.

**Named NPCs:**
To be developed. Tier 3 can support named figures as petitioners, delegates, judges, and long-term residents—people who have hung their coat on the Wegtafel. Use for rumors, letters home, and the social world of the tea houses. Regula Felber may appear or be referenced if she has business at the Stift.

**Plot Keys:**

## Encounter Flavor

**Universal Modifiers:**
Tier 1: Wind in hollows. Timber and smoke. Slate gray, weathered wood, coal black, autumn red. Vertical lines, switchbacks, angled roofs. Kin over crown, memory over law. Tier 2: Austere institutional stone and timber. Clean lines. Silence and reading light. The sense that the whole system is visible from here—and that individual suffering is a statistic. Tier 3: Granite caverns and rationed light. Then tea houses, warm and intimate. The Wegtafel. The Wandelgang. Procedure that never quite ends. Comfort that converts adversaries into peers.

## Open Questions

- Named NPCs for Safe Zone and tier 3 (petitioners, delegates, judges, long-term Stift residents)—to be filled when encounter design assigns names and roles.
- Plot keys for all tiers—to be defined when encounter design establishes set_key/check_key strings and semantic contracts.
- Whether the Stift has additional proper names (in-world or design-only) for specific halls, courts, or offices.
- Flora and fauna: only lightly specified in source notes; expand if future encounter or provisioning design requires it.
- Weapons and armor: inferred from labor and tone; no explicit list in source—refine if combat or equipment tables need it.
