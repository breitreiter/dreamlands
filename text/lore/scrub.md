# High Mesa Corridor

## Identity

**Theme / Philosophy:**
Wind-cut plateaus and dry riverbeds define a frontier where kinship and administration grind against each other under an ambiguous cosmic order called the Lattice. This is a place where honor-based clan politics collide with procedural bureaucracy, where hospitality is both binding and political, and where rail lines cut across ancestral territory. But the tension is not simply between two models of human order. The Kesharat Administration is no longer entirely human in its thinking: it has been compromised by an extra-dimensional intelligence that colonizes minds and reshapes societies into instruments of its own expansion.

**Defining Contradiction:**
Long ago, the Kesharat was a functional martial empire built on conquest—not admirable, but comprehensible. Through brute stupidity, they destroyed the people who had been containing an extra-dimensional entity. The Lattice was unleashed, and it consumed their leadership—not physically, but as a parasite consumes the will of its host. The empire ceased to be about martial conquest and honor; it became a machine. The Lattice is simultaneously a hyper-intelligent phenomenon, a manifestation perceived as an indescribable Color at inflection points in physical space, the entity's drive to colonize and reshape the world, the decrees issued by compromised leadership, and a totalizing ideology of order that serves the entity's expansion. Clans insist the Kesharat worships the Lattice; the Kesharat insists it is merely alignment. Both are wrong. The Lattice is not a god to be worshiped or a principle to be followed—it is an occupying intelligence, and the Kesharat are its instruments.

## The Land

**Terrain & Geography:**
The High Mesa Corridor is dominated by wind-cut plateaus, terraced valleys, dry riverbeds, and salt flats. The terrain is high, exposed, and arid. Infrastructure includes rail lines that cut through the landscape, connecting administrative towns and cutting across clan-controlled passes and wells. The map representation follows the same 100×100 tile structure as other biomes (10,000 tiles total, each approximately 4 miles across), with mesa regions appearing as named, contiguous clusters.

**Weather & Seasonal Hazards:**
Mesa weather is defined by extremes and exposure. Days are hot with intense sun and little shade; nights can be surprisingly cold on exposed plateaus. Seasonal dust storms are common, reducing visibility and making travel dangerous. Wind is nearly constant, carrying grit that abrades exposed skin and equipment. The campaign's autumn timing means players avoid the worst summer heat, but still face dehydration risk, dust inhalation, and temperature swings between day and night. Rain is rare and unpredictable—when it comes, dry riverbeds can flash-flood with little warning.

**Flora of Note:**
Vegetation is sparse and drought-resistant. Hardy scrub brush, thorny acacia, prickly pear cactus, and tough grasses dominate. Date palms and fig trees cluster near water sources and are jealously guarded by whoever controls the well or spring. Some plants produce useful materials: acacia yields gum and tannins; certain thorny shrubs can be rendered for medicinal resins; and dried cactus pads serve as emergency water storage. Flora density increases in terraced valleys where clan agriculture has coaxed life from the land through generations of careful water management.

**Fauna of Note:**
The mesa supports hardy desert fauna adapted to scarcity. Goats are the primary livestock—resilient, able to browse on scrub, and providing meat, milk, and hides. Lizards and scorpions are common pests and emergency food sources. Birds of prey (hawks, vultures) circle overhead. Venomous snakes inhabit rocky crevices. Wild predators include jackals and, in more remote areas, desert cats. Camels or similar pack animals may be used by wealthy caravans, though their availability varies by settlement. Locusts appear seasonally and are harvested as protein (smoked or spiced for preservation).

## Peoples

### Plateau Clans

**Overview:**
Highland kin-groups controlling passes, wells, and terraced valleys. They practice honor-based kinship with strong local autonomy. Outsiders must negotiate passage. Hospitality is binding but political. They are not desert princes—they are mountain plateau tribes with a structural resemblance to Afghan highland culture.

**Settlement Names:**
Settlement names use harder consonants and compact structures. Examples include Gharok, Tarsin, Drazhul, Sarghun Ridge, Kethar Pass, and Vornak Hollow. Structure follows the pattern of single-word place names or name plus landform (e.g., "Sarghun Ridge").

**Architecture:**
Stone compounds with narrow windows, defensive hilltop villages, courtyard houses, and terraced fields in narrow valleys. Wind-scoured banners are common. The style is heavy, irregular, and practical—built for defense and survival, not display. Buildings use local stone and mudbrick, with flat roofs for sleeping on hot nights. Compounds are organized around central courtyards that provide wind protection and privacy. Defensive walls are functional, not ornamental.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Clan folk dress for sun, wind, and modesty. Layered robes in undyed or earth-toned fabrics (dusty browns, grays) protect from elements while allowing ventilation. Head coverings (wrapped cloth, simple turbans) are universal for sun protection. Wealthier individuals wear dyed fabrics and decorative metalwork (arm rings, belt fittings, elaborate knife sheaths). Fighters and hunters favor tighter wraps for mobility. Status is signaled through quality of weave, subtle embroidery, and metalwork rather than bright colors. Clan affiliation may be indicated by specific wrap styles or jewelry patterns known to locals but opaque to outsiders.

**Names:**
- *Given names:* Zarik, Davun, Haris, Nadir, Sorin, Kalen, Arva, Selim, Tarek
- *Surnames / epithets:* Names typically follow a clan-based structure rather than fixed surnames.
- *Linguistic patterns:* Hard stops (k, g, t, d), aspirates (kh, gh), strong r, and short vowels. Settlement names are compact. Personal names follow the structure of Given + Father + Clan (e.g., "Zarik Davun of Tarsin").

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Hospitality is binding but political. Merchants who respect protocol—announcing themselves properly, accepting offered food and drink, acknowledging the host's authority—are generally safe and may trade freely. Those who violate customs (refusing hospitality, showing disrespect, attempting to bypass checkpoints) face hostility ranging from social exclusion to violence. Reputation matters enormously: merchants with established relationships trade easily; unknowns must prove themselves. Clans compete for caravan traffic and will offer competitive terms to secure ongoing trade relationships. News and gossip are as valuable as goods—merchants who carry messages and information gain favor.

### Kesharat Administration

**Overview:**
Descendants of a fallen empire, now civil stewards of infrastructure, rail, census, and quotas. They were once a martial conquest society; they are now something else. Their leadership has been compromised by the Lattice—an extra-dimensional intelligence that colonizes minds and reshapes institutions into instruments of its expansion. The Kesharat acts "in alignment with the Lattice," but this is not doctrine or philosophy in the ordinary sense: it is the manifest will of an occupying entity, filtered through human bureaucracy. Lower-ranking personnel may not fully understand what has happened to their superiors, but they follow procedures, enforce quotas, and expand infrastructure with unshakable certainty that they are bringing order to the world.

**Settlement Names:**
Settlement names are balanced, symmetrical, and measured: two or three syllables, vowel-balanced. Examples include Talvek, Orast, Velyr, Qastor, Sevar, Luro, Meiren, and Vostrum.

**Architecture:**
Square mudbrick or pale stone towns with interior courtyards, rail platforms, signal towers, clean geometric lines, and faded imperial insignia (sunburst, radial sigils). The aesthetic is one of order imposed on dust—a skeletal empire maintaining procedural continuity. In tier 3 territories, architecture becomes geometrically perfect in ways that are subtly wrong: angles too precise, symmetry too complete, surfaces that seem to reflect light incorrectly.

**Clothing & Appearance:**
Kesharat personnel favor clean, standardized clothing that signals rank and function. Lower-ranking functionaries wear simple tunics or robes in neutral colors (pale gray, sand, off-white) with minimal decoration. Rank is indicated through sashes, badges, or geometric insignia pins. Higher-ranking officials wear more elaborate versions with precise pleating and formal cuts. Clothing is practical but emphasizes conformity over individual expression. In tier 3 territories, personnel may wear garments that seem to shimmer with that indescribable Color, or exhibit unnatural symmetry in their folds. Disorder—stains, tears, misalignment—is conspicuously absent even in field conditions, which reads as unsettling rather than professional.

**Names:**
- *Given names:* Qiren, Lian, Darun, Meilin, Halren, Tarek, Zhen, Velor, Sarin
- *Surnames / epithets:* Talvek, Vasar, Qastor, Sevar, Orast, Velyr, Luro
- *Linguistic patterns:* Balanced syllables, vowel harmony. Structure follows Given + Family (e.g., "Qiren Talvek" or "Meilin Vasar"). Titles matter and are used formally: Prefect Talvek, Registrar Velyr.

**Disposition Toward Merchants:**
Kesharat settlements trade actively but bureaucratically. Merchants must register at entry, declare goods, and pay standardized tariffs. There is no haggling with officials—prices and procedures are fixed. However, the Kesharat values efficiency and predictability; merchants who follow procedure trade freely and benefit from well-maintained infrastructure (the rail, secure depots, standardized weights and measures). In tier 1-2 territories, Kesharat towns are reliable trade partners if you tolerate the paperwork. In tier 3, trade continues but takes on a surreal quality: transactions are processed with eerie precision, goods are examined by personnel whose eyes reflect wrong colors, and the prices offered for certain materials (geometrically perfect crystals, Color-touched items) seem irrationally high—until you realize what the Kesharat intends to do with them.

### Relations Between Groups

Plateau clans value loyalty to blood, personal vengeance, and hospitality as power. They are deeply suspicious of census and rail systems, viewing them as tools of outside control and potential idolatry. Some clan elders remember when the Kesharat was merely a brutal conquest empire—comprehensible enemies who could be negotiated with, ambushed, or driven off. The current Kesharat unsettles them in ways they struggle to articulate: the functionaries speak reasonably but do not negotiate in good faith; the patrols enforce quotas that make no economic sense; and the civil priests explain the Lattice with evangelical patience but somehow make less sense the longer they talk.

The Kesharat Administration values loyalty to system, quotas over grudges, and regulated hospitality. They justify expansion as alignment with the Lattice, framing administrative control as necessary correction rather than conquest. Most lower-ranking personnel are not consciously serving an alien intelligence—they believe they are civil servants maintaining order and infrastructure. They have been taught that the Lattice is the underlying pattern of reality, and that alignment is both rational and inevitable. Higher-ranking officials exhibit increasingly alien patterns of thought: their explanations are internally coherent but rest on premises that do not map to human concerns.

Tension between the groups is structural and pervasive: clan autonomy conflicts with administrative procedure, oral law with written codes, kinship obligations with impersonal quotas. The Lattice serves as both point of conflict (the clans accuse the administration of worshiping it, which the administration denies) and the invisible hand behind policy shifts that neither group fully controls. Rail routes and borders change without explanation because the Lattice is optimizing for goals that are not human.

## The Lattice: Language Across Tiers

The way Kesharat personnel speak about the Lattice changes dramatically depending on how close you are to its direct influence.

**Tier 1 (Innocent and Philosophical):**
In clan-dominated borderlands, the few Kesharat personnel you encounter speak of the Lattice in abstract, almost wistful terms. They sound like homesick believers trying to explain their faith to skeptical foreigners.

- "I'm trying to find my place in the Lattice."
- "It's lonely being so far from the structure of the Lattice."
- "How do you folks know what is right and wrong without the Lattice to guide you? Do you just make up rules as you go?"

These statements sound reasonable, even sympathetic. They present the Lattice as a framework for meaning and moral clarity—something the clans might dismiss as foreign superstition, but not something overtly threatening.

**Tier 2 (Sinister and Bureaucratic):**
As you enter Kesharat-controlled territory, the language shifts. Personnel still sound rational, but there is an edge of certainty that brooks no argument. The Lattice is no longer just personal guidance—it is systemic authority, collective purpose, and justification for coercion.

- "The Lattice gives us strength. Every man, woman, and child knows their role."
- "The rail spreads the Lattice, brings safety to new lands."
- "This woman has been judged according to the Lattice, and must be brought into alignment with the correct way of things."

The phrasing is bureaucratic and impersonal. "Alignment" sounds like procedure, not punishment. The speakers believe they are performing necessary corrections, not acts of violence. This is the language of occupied minds that still retain enough human context to justify their actions in human terms.

**Tier 3 (Overt Horror):**
In the deep Kesharat territories, the pretense collapses. Personnel speak of the Lattice as an autonomous force—something vast, hungry, and unstoppable. They may speak with fear, awe, resignation, or evangelical fervor, but they no longer pretend it is merely a philosophy.

- "The Lattice's hunger is insatiable. It will consume this entire world."
- "Their bodies are ruined by the strange energies of the Lattice."
- "Those who witness the Lattice directly go mad."

Some speakers sound like victims, describing the Lattice as an external threat they are powerless to resist. Others sound like true believers, treating its consumption of the world as inevitable and even desirable. Both are correct: the Lattice is a threat, and they cannot resist it, because it is already inside them.

## Material Culture

**Weapons:**
Scrub weapons reflect the harsh environment and two distinct cultural traditions. Crude quality weapons include the jambiya (dagger), cracked scimitar (sword), and sun-bleached spear. Good quality weapons include the curved sword, desert lance, and iron khopesh. Fine weapons are prized possessions: damascus scimitars and jewelled tulwars, often family heirlooms or symbols of status. Improvised weapons would include shepherd's crooks, weighted slings, and walking staves.

**Armor:**
Scrub armor emphasizes mobility and heat management over heavy protection. Crude quality includes desert robes and sand-leather wraps—practical gear for both cultures. Good quality armor includes lamellar cuirass and mirror armor, more common among administrative guards and wealthy clan warriors. Fine quality includes gilded lamellar and sun king's plate—ceremonial or elite gear rarely seen on the road.

**Foods & Provisions:**
Mesa foodways are built around scarcity and preservation. Common vendor staples include goat jerky, smoked lizard, spiced locusts (protein); flatbread, millet cake, dust crackers (carbs); and date paste, fig leather, tamarind chew (sweets). Typical foraged foods include scorpion, sun-dried gecko, beetle grubs (protein); prickly pear flesh, dry roots, dust yam (carbs); and dried cactus fruit, bitter figs, ant honey (sweets). Foraging in the scrub is particularly difficult (–3 penalty) due to sparse vegetation.

**Trade Goods:**
The mesa corridor is a crossroads where clan production meets Kesharat industrial output and rail-imported luxuries.

**Clan territories produce:**
- Rare spices (saffron-like threads, pungent seed pods, sun-dried aromatics highly prized in forest and plains cuisine)
- Preserved foods (dried dates, fig leather, potted meats—evil-smelling but filling and shelf-stable)
- Salt (from the flats; basic commodity with steady demand)
- Goat products (tanned hides, coarse wool, horn and bone for tool handles)
- Handcrafted metalwork (decorative knife work, jewelry, small luxury items made by clan artisans)

**Kesharat territories produce and import:**
- Sophisticated alloys (precision-grade metals produced in Kesharat foundries, used for fine tools and clockwork mechanisms)
- Medicines (pharmaceutical preparations—tonics, extracts, salves—produced under controlled conditions; effective but increasingly tainted by the Lattice in tier 3 sources)
- Geometrically perfect crystals and alignment materials (in tier 3; these command irrational prices and are profoundly unsettling)
- Silks and fine-woven cloth (luxury imports tracked in by rail from distant regions)
- Standardized industrial goods (uniform nails, screws, hinges, fittings—boring but valuable)

**The mesa hungers for:**
- Spicewood and timber (from forest biome; essential for construction, fuel, and tool handles in treeless plateau regions)
- Quality iron tools and weapons (from mountain forges; valued by both clans and Kesharat)
- Exotic foods and luxuries (swamp spices, plains grain alcohol, forest tonics)
- Mercenary labor and skilled tradespeople (both factions need outsiders for work their own people won't or can't do)

**Consumables & Prevention Items:**
Standard prevention items useful in the mesa include canteens (essential for thirst management in arid terrain), dust masks (resist rot_lung from dust storms), and warm clothing (nights can be cold on exposed plateaus). Camping gear helps resist cold and exhaustion. Sturdy boots or better help prevent exhaustion from long treks across broken terrain. Map kits are particularly valuable given the sparse landmarks and the fact that rail routes and borders may shift without warning.

## Distance Tiers

### Safe Zone

**Vibe:**
This is the borderlands between polite society and the scrubs: a trading frontier dominated by clan caravans and merchant traffic. The Kesharat Administration is absent or irrelevant here—if a functionary or courier appears at all, they are far from their source of authority and subject to merciless teasing by the locals. In tier 1, the Kesharat are played for laughs: nerds and fish out of water in the rough-and-tumble trade camps. Clan folk give them metaphorical atomic wedgies—mocking their paperwork, their accents, their inability to read the room. The Kesharat who show up here are hapless, outnumbered, and hopelessly out of their depth.

**Tensions:**
Tensions are primarily economic and social. Clan hospitality is binding but political: who is offered guest-right and who is not signals allegiances and old grudges. Passage through clan territory must be negotiated, and tolls or tribute may be expected. Reputation matters: word travels between caravans about which merchants are trustworthy, which clans are honorable, and which routes are safer this season. Gossip is currency. Disputes over precedent, insults to honor, and arguments about trade terms are common but rarely escalate to violence in tier 1.

**Typical Trouble:**
Typical encounters include negotiating passage with a clan checkpoint; meeting a merchant caravan heading in the opposite direction and trading news or goods; being pressed to share a meal and hearing lengthy stories about clan history; encountering a miserable Kesharat courier who has been robbed or mocked and needs help (or who suspects you of working for the clans); discovering that the pass you intended to use is currently closed due to a clan feud; being asked to carry a message or small parcel to another settlement; and overhearing rumors about increased Kesharat activity deeper in the mesa.

**Named NPCs:**

### Wildlands

**Vibe:**
The mood shifts as Kesharat settlements appear along the rail lines. The comedy of tier 1 drops away: here the Kesharat are no longer laughable. They are clearly an occupying force. Armed patrols walk the roads—not entirely safe, but making a deliberate show of force. The tension between clans and Kesharat becomes visible and sometimes violent. You begin to see construction: rail lines extending into contested territory, worked by unfamiliar laborers under Kesharat supervision.

**Defining Conflicts:**
The defining conflict is territorial and systemic. The Kesharat Administration is expanding infrastructure—rail, depots, signal towers—into clan-held land, justified as "alignment with the Lattice." Clans resist through a mix of negotiation, obstruction, and violence. Water rights are a flashpoint: wells and springs that were clan property for generations are now claimed by administrative decree. The rail brings labor from elsewhere—people the clans do not recognize and cannot negotiate with, working under conditions the clans find disturbing. Meanwhile, Kesharat civil priests attempt to explain the Lattice to skeptical or hostile audiences, insisting it is not worship but principle.

**Typical Trouble:**
Typical wildlands encounters include witnessing a water rights dispute escalate into a standoff; encountering an armed Kesharat patrol and being questioned about your destination and business; finding a clan camp that has been raided, with people dragged off for "census correction"; discovering a Kesharat functionary hung from a tree, hands severed and placed below the body as a message; meeting rail construction crews and the strangers laboring under Kesharat overseers; being caught between a clan ambush and a Kesharat patrol; overhearing or being invited to a meeting where a civil priest explains the Lattice (clans interpret this as religious proselytization; the priest insists it is education); and encountering refugees—both clan families fleeing administrative pressure and Kesharat personnel who have deserted or been driven out.

**Narrative Threads:**
The rail is always advancing. Each time the player returns to tier 2, construction has progressed: new track laid, new depots established, and new territory claimed. Some clans negotiate; others resist. A few individuals on both sides attempt to broker peace or understanding, but structural forces make resolution unlikely. Rumors circulate about what happens to those taken by patrols—some say they are sent to work in distant lands, others that they are relocated to "alignment settlements" deeper in Kesharat territory.

**Named NPCs:**
Tomak - more serious now, reveals he is here to kill the leader of the Kesharat.

### Final Horror

**Vibe:**
This is the horror of being an outsider in a foreign land where you do not speak the language and are made to feel unwelcome at every turn. You are at the true edge of the Kesharat empire, where the Lattice's influence is no longer filtered through layers of bureaucracy. The air feels wrong—too still, or vibrating at a frequency just below hearing. Colors seem oversaturated or drained depending on proximity to certain structures, but there is also *another* color: one that has no name, that cannot be properly perceived, that illuminates or shades nearby objects in ways that hurt to look at. You are being watched, but not by people who care whether you live or die. You are being watched by something that is deciding whether you are useful.

**The Horror Itself:**
The Lattice is a hyper-intelligent extra-dimensional entity that colonizes minds and reshapes reality at inflection points in physical space. It manifests as the Colors—indescribable hues that appear where the entity's influence is strongest, illuminating or shading nearby matter in ways that defy description. Prolonged exposure to the Colors ruins the body: skin takes on unnatural tones, eyes cloud or burn with alien light, and movement becomes mechanical. Workers subjected to the Colors lose individuality, becoming human machines—alive, functional, and utterly broken. This is not a byproduct of Kesharat cruelty; it is the Lattice optimizing human biology for tasks it has determined are necessary. Kesharat leadership is fully compromised: they are no longer making decisions in any human sense, but rather acting as the Lattice's administrative layer. Lower-ranking true believers insist this is correction and alignment, a necessary process that will eventually crystallize order across all lands. They cannot imagine resistance because their capacity to imagine alternatives has been systematically eroded.

In tier 3, the Kesharat become a little sympathetic again. As you learn more about what has been done to them—the colonization of minds, the erosion of will, the way the Lattice uses human bureaucracy as its instrument—it is harder to see them purely as villains. They are victims too, even when they are doing the Lattice's work. That does not make them safe. It makes the horror stickier.

**Conflicts & Tensions:**
There is no negotiation here. The Kesharat Administration operates with the certainty of an occupied mind: the Lattice is spreading, the Colors are tools of alignment, and resistance is deviation that must be corrected. Clan identity is irrelevant; all people are potential substrate for optimization. The conflicts are not political but existential: do you intervene, knowing you cannot win? Do you bear witness, knowing what you see may break you? Do you take advantage of the chaos to profit, and live with what that means? The deeper question—can the Lattice be stopped, or even slowed—is beyond the scope of individual action.

**Typical Trouble:**
Tier 3 encounters emphasize moral horror and powerlessness. The player may witness laborers exposed to the Colors—bodies glowing faintly with that indescribable hue, movements synchronized, eyes empty—and realize intervention would be suicidal. They may be stopped at a checkpoint by Kesharat enforcers who are no longer entirely human, their speech flat and their logic alien. They may meet a civil priest who speaks calmly about the beauty of crystallization, the perfection of order, and the inevitable spread of the Lattice, while gesturing to a work site where people are being systematically destroyed. They may encounter a rebel who begs them to carry a message out—not a call for help, but a warning to stay away. They may find an "alignment settlement" where architecture has become geometrically perfect in unnatural ways, where the Colors bleed through cracks in walls, and where inhabitants move in eerie synchronization. They may be offered hospitality by Kesharat personnel who insist everything is normal, even as the walls hum and the food tastes like metal and light bends wrong in the corners of rooms.

**Rewards & Temptations:**
Few enter tier 3 voluntarily. Those who do are typically motivated by desperation: a loved one taken by patrols, rumors of a lost caravan carrying irreplaceable goods, or the need to reach a destination on the far side of Kesharat territory. The Kesharat rail network offers fast travel through otherwise impassable terrain, making it a calculated risk for merchants in a hurry. Some seek forbidden knowledge: what is the Lattice, really? How does it work, and can it be resisted? The Kesharat will explain, enthusiastically—but the explanations themselves may be dangerous, planting seeds of the entity's logic in your mind. Others come seeking profit: Kesharat administrative towns still trade, and goods aligned with the Lattice (geometrically perfect crystals, Color-touched materials, precision instruments) command high prices in distant markets, if you can get them out. The Lattice does not object to commerce; it simply optimizes the terms.

**Area-Specific Encounters:**
Encounters unique to tier 3 include:

- **Color exposure events:** Witnessing or narrowly avoiding exposure to the Lattice's manifestations. The Colors appear at inflection points in space—doorways, junctions, peaks, boundaries. Mechanical effects may include temporary conditions (disoriented, marked, resonating) that make the player trackable or vulnerable to further exposure. Long-term exposure begins the process of optimization.
- **Enforcer checkpoints:** Stopped by Kesharat enforcers who are no longer fully human. Their questions follow alien logic: "What is your function?" "Have you been optimized?" "Do you consent to alignment?" Wrong answers have consequences.
- **Alignment settlements:** Entering a town where geometry is too perfect, where the Colors bleed through walls and pavement, where inhabitants move with unnatural coordination, and where hospitality is extended with unsettling sincerity by people who no longer fully understand what hospitality means.
- **Work sites:** Watching people labor under Color exposure. The overseers are calm, professional, and explain the process if asked: "They are being aligned. It is necessary. They will be more efficient afterward." The workers do not respond to outside stimulus. Their eyes reflect that impossible color.
- **Deserter warnings:** Brief, desperate encounters with people who have fled Kesharat service and are trying to escape tier 3. They will not travel with you—they believe they are being tracked—but they will warn you about what lies ahead. Some speak of the Colors. Others refuse to describe what they saw, insisting you would not believe them.
- **True believer evangelism:** Kesharat civil priests or administrators who genuinely want to help you understand the Lattice. They are not hostile. They are patient, articulate, and utterly certain. The longer you listen, the more sense they make, and that is the danger: you are being exposed to the Lattice's logic, which is parasitic and self-replicating.
- **Rebel contact:** Secretive, frightened people who have not yet fled but who try to communicate warnings through coded language, written notes, or meaningful silence. They know the Lattice can perceive intent; they are trying not to think too loudly.
- **Evidence of the old empire:** Faded murals, abandoned armories, journals from before the Lattice. Reminders that the Kesharat was once human—brutal, but human. This makes what they have become more horrifying, not less.

**Named NPCs:**
Tomak - in the moments before his death, reveals he was a boy at the monastery where the Lattice was unleashed from, that he's been putting off trying to go back and contain it, and now he finally felt he had to. he made it pretty far before they stopped him.
