The Oldwood Deep
Past the last trail, past the point where the canopy climbs so high it stops feeling like a ceiling and starts feeling like a sky, the forest changes. Not dramatically. That's the worst part. The trees just get bigger, gradually, until you realize the fern you're walking past is thirty feet tall and you've been navigating by a landmark that's actually miles further away than you thought. Scale comes unmoored. A day's travel covers what should be an hour's ground, or the reverse. Your maps stop agreeing with your feet.

No one lives here. Nothing marks the trail because there is no trail. You are the first person to step on this specific patch of earth and the forest does not notice and does not care. The silence isn't menacing — it's indifferent, the silence of a place that never expected you and will not remember you. You start talking to yourself by day two. By day four you stop, because your voice sounds wrong against the quiet, too small, like shouting into a cathedral and hearing how little of it you fill.
