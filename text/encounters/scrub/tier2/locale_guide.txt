# The Barrens

Past the caravanserais and oasis towns, the steppe dries out and breaks apart. The water table drops. The wells get further apart, less reliable, and controlled by whoever has the most swords. The trade roads thin to tracks, then to nothing. This is country that empires claimed on maps but never governed—warlord territory, disputed passes, the margins where herder clans and outlaw bands blur together.

And yet there is wealth here, if you can survive the getting of it. Spice plants grow in the dry ravines—tough, aromatic shrubs that thrive in poor soil and brutal heat. The highland scrub produces dye-plants and fibers that lowland weavers pay dearly for. The people who harvest these things are hard to find and harder to bargain with, because they know what the goods are worth and they know you can't get them yourself.

The terrain is broken—ravines, dry washes, boulder fields, dust. Navigation is by landmark and the landmarks move when the wind reshapes the dunes. Heat is dangerous in the day, cold is dangerous at night, and the transition between them is faster than you'd expect.

## Encounters

Territorial warlords, desperate outlaws, and the natural hazards of arid badlands. Not every encounter is hostile—some are transactional, some are territorial warnings—but nobody out here is relaxed. Water scarcity drives most conflict.

Encounters should feel tense, dry, and jurisdictionally ambiguous. Authority is local and armed. Hospitality still exists but it's conditional, calculated, offered by people who are deciding whether you're useful or a threat. The landscape's value as a source of spices and dye-plants should be visible in the world.

## Scene Palette

Characters: a spice harvester working a ravine with cracked hands and a knife, a dye-maker with forearms stained indigo to the elbow, a warlord's toll collector who is polite in a way that isn't reassuring, a herder clan outrider watching from a ridge, a merchant who came out here for the margins and is regretting it, a water-seller with an armed escort and no negotiable prices, a weaver buying raw fiber in bulk and packing it like it's gold, a dervish walking barefoot across the hardpan who seems unbothered by everything, an outlaw who offers to guide you for a price that might be fair, a woman drying spice bundles on a flat rock who doesn't look up when you approach

Objects: bundles of dried spice plants tied with cord, a dye vat improvised from a hollow rock staining the ground around it, a water skin that's lighter than you'd like, a toll marker—a cairn with a painted stone meaning "you owe someone," a worn knife with a blade shaped by years of cutting tough stems, skeins of fiber dyed in colors too vivid for this landscape, a map scratched into a flat stone at a crossroads, a cache of trade goods hidden under rocks, a brass teapot battered enough to have crossed the barrens fifty times, a spice bundle fragrant enough to smell from twenty paces

Sensory: heat shimmer erasing the horizon, the crunch of mineral crust underfoot, wind that scours exposed skin, the sharp smell of wild spice in a sheltered ravine, the absolute silence of midday when everything alive is hiding from the sun, the sudden cold when a cloud crosses the sun in high country, the taste of alkaline water, dust that works into everything, the low whistle of wind through a slot canyon, the distant bleating of goats you can hear but not see

Activities: rationing water with grim arithmetic, following a dry wash looking for where the spice plants cluster, negotiating passage through territory that belongs to someone, sheltering from midday heat under an overhang, evaluating whether an approaching rider is a threat, bartering with a harvester who knows you need what she has, navigating by a landmark that doesn't match the description you were given, wrapping cloth around your face against blowing dust, making camp in a ravine for wind shelter, studying a scratched-stone map and disagreeing about what it means

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a spice harvester mentions that the best plants grow deeper in the barrens where she won't go anymore, a toll collector explains the fee for passage and what happens to people who don't pay, a merchant's pack animal collapses from heat and he has to decide what to leave behind
