The Ghassuleth
A vast dead plateau of black rock and glassy sand where the wind sounds like recitation in a language no living scholar reads. Carved into the mesa walls are thousands of empty tombs — empty not because they were robbed, but because whatever was interred got up and left. Caravans skirt the edges and pay guides who navigate by the taste of the dust. At the center stands a city with no doors, no windows, and no gate, and yet firelight is sometimes seen inside.

we could go the Ultraviolet Grasslands approach. There's a whole mirror civilization here. they're just weird as hell. the danger is that you offend their bizarre customs and they zorch you with weird magic. you're like a dislocated medieval peddler in downtown new york. No one wants to buy your peppercorns, weirdo.
