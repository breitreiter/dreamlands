The Courier

The Kesharat courier stands in full sun, sweat darkening the collar of his rumpled official coat. The leather document case lies in the dust between his boots and the clan trader's sandals. The trader picked it up when the courier dropped it—fumbled it, really, after the man made some crack about plateau illiteracy loud enough for the whole watering station to hear. Now the trader holds it at arm's length, recounting the insult word for word to the gathering crowd. Laughter ripples through them. The courier's face has gone red, though whether from heat or humiliation is hard to say.

You catch the shift in the crowd's mood before the courier does. The laughter has an edge now. Someone mutters about arrogant lowlanders. A woman spits in the dust. The trader is still talking, working them like a merchant working a sale, and the courier keeps demanding his property back in that clipped administrative accent that makes everything sound like a reprimand. The signet ring on your hand catches light—the Merchant Guild mark that means you walk between worlds, neither clan nor Kesharat but trusted by both when coin is involved. The courier sees it. His eyes fix on you like a drowning man spotting driftwood.

The trader wants an apology. The courier would sooner eat glass. And the crowd—wind carries their voices across the exposed stone, a low buzz of old resentments given sudden shape. If they lay hands on him, the Kesharat will answer it. Not here, not now. But somewhere a clan will wake to soldiers at their gates, and a debt will be collected that has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with the appearance of authority. The elder under the awning hasn't moved, but his eyes are open. Watching.

The trader holds the case higher. The crowd presses closer. The courier's hand drifts toward his belt where no weapon hangs.


choices:

* PERSUADE the trader = Appeal to the trader's sense of self-preservation and clan honor
  You step into the gap between them. The words come measured, pitched for the crowd as much as the trader. The Kesharat remembers insults like the plateau remembers water. Not here, not today, but someone will pay. A cousin's caravan stopped at a checkpoint. A clan's grazing rights questioned by men with ledgers and swords. The trader's eyes narrow, but you see the calculation there. You turn the signet ring so the mark catches light. The Merchant Guild has carried messages between these worlds for three generations. You know what retribution looks like when it crosses borders.

    The trader lowers the case. Not a surrender, but a repositioning. He addresses the crowd, not the courier. Says he found property that wasn't his and returned it as clan law demands, insult or no insult. The case lands in the dust at the courier's feet. The courier snatches it up, clutching it like a child with a stolen cake. He nods once to you, stiff and graceless, and retreats toward his mount. The crowd disperses with the slow reluctance of a disappointed audience. The trader meets your eyes. No gratitude there, but recognition. You've given him the story he can tell tonight, the one where he's generous and the lowlander is a fool.

    The trader's face hardens. He asks the crowd if they're dogs who roll over when the Kesharat snap their fingers. Someone shouts agreement. You see the moment slip like sand through spread fingers. The trader opens the case, breaks the wax seal with his thumb. Papers spill into the wind. The courier lunges. Three men catch him, pin his arms, not gently. No blows fall, but the message is written in grip and stance. The courier is released after long minutes, stumbling, papers scattered across twenty paces of plateau stone. He gathers what he can with shaking hands. Doesn't look at you. The crowd watches him leave, and their laughter follows him like carrion birds.

* INTIMIDATE the trader = Use the weight of the Merchant Guild to make the trader yield
  You don't raise your voice. Volume is for people without leverage. You show the signet ring, let the sun catch the mark that means every trading post between here and the coast. Ask the trader which clans he sells to. Ask if he's considered how many of them hold Merchant Guild letters of credit. The words land like stones in still water. The crowd shifts, uncertain now. Guild membership isn't just about coin. It's about roads that stay open and goods that cross borders without entanglement. You let the silence stretch.

    The trader's jaw works. He spits in the dust, but his hand opens. The case drops. He tells the courier to take his trash and his manners back where they came from. The courier grabs the case, cradles it against his chest. Mumbles something that might be thanks to you, might be a curse. The trader turns his back, loud conversation about anyone who needs outsiders to fight their battles. But the crowd is already losing interest, drifting back to their own transactions. The elder under the awning nods once. You've made your point without making an enemy. The currency of it will spend for a while yet.

    The trader laughs. Asks if you're threatening a man for picking up what another dropped. The crowd murmurs, and the sound isn't friendly. Someone mentions a cousin who got squeezed by Guild rates last summer. Another voice adds a grievance about weighted scales. The trader is smiling now, playing to his audience. Your ring suddenly feels heavier, more visible. The courier looks at you with something between hope and panic. The trader tosses the case in the air, catches it. Asks if you'd like to buy it back, maybe. The price is an apology. Not from him. From you. The elder under the awning is watching with the particular attention of someone who will remember what happens next.

* PAY the trader = Offer coin to resolve the situation
  You pull the purse from your belt, pour coins into your palm. Silver catches light like water in drought country. Don't address the insult, don't adjudicate who owes what to whom. Just ask what the finder's fee is for lost property. Frame it as custom, as proper form. The trader's eyes fix on your hand. The crowd quiets. Money makes things simple in ways that honor never does.

  The trader names a price. Not outrageous, but not generous either. The courier starts to object, but you silence him with a look. You count out the coins into the trader's palm. The exchange happens with the small ceremony that all plateau transactions demand. The trader hands over the case, bows with theatrical courtesy. Tells the courier that civilized people settle matters with trade, not tantrum. The courier takes the case, face burning. Looks at you with naked relief and something more complicated underneath. You've saved him, but you've also made him small in front of witnesses. The crowd disperses. The elder under the awning returns to his tea. Debt paid, story finished, everyone walks away with something to tell.

* Ignore = Walk past without involvement
  You adjust your pack and turn toward the road. The courier calls after you, voice cracking with desperation. You keep walking. Behind you the voices rise, the trader's performance reaching its crescendo. The crowd's laughter has teeth in it now. Your boots find the packed earth of the caravan track. Dust plumes with each step. The sounds fade slower than you'd like.

  A half mile on, you hear hoofbeats. The courier passes at a gallop, hunched low, no document case visible. His mount's flanks are lathered. He doesn't look at you. Further still, you pass a woman leading a pack goat. She mentions that some Kesharat fool got himself rolled at the watering station. Lost his papers, lost his dignity, rode off like demons were chasing him. She seems to find it funny. You ask if anyone was hurt. She shrugs. Says the clans know better than to leave marks the Kesharat can see. You walk on. The wind carries dust and distance. Whatever accounting follows will happen far from here, in offices and checkpoints where your ring holds no weight.
