# The Mesa Borderlands

Where the plateaus flatten into trading country, clan territory begins. Wind-cut stone, dry riverbeds, and terraced valleys. Life here runs on trade, obligation, and reputation—who owes what, who said what, and who witnessed it. The Kesharat Administration is barely here—a courier or functionary now and then, far from home, getting mercilessly teased by clan folk who find their paperwork and their accents absurd. This is clan ground. Hospitality is binding, but it's also political: who gets guest-right and who doesn't signals old grudges and current allegiances.

The terrain is high, exposed, and arid. Hard light and long shadows. Pale stone, rust-red earth, bleached wood, hard blue sky. The wind never stops and carries grit. Shade is scarce. Everyone is going somewhere or selling something. Gossip is currency—who cheated a trade partner, which clan matriarch has declared a debt forgiven, whose son insulted whose daughter at market. Stakes are personal: pride, debt, obligation, the wrong word at the wrong table.

## Encounters

No monsters or bandits. The worst here is a deal gone sideways, a public accusation, or a clan elder who decides you haven't shown proper respect.

Encounters should feel dry, social, and transactional. Settle a debt dispute between traders. Share a meal and discover your host expects a favor in return. Carry a message you weren't supposed to read. Run into a miserable Kesharat courier who's been robbed or mocked and needs help—or who suspects you of working for the clans. Get drawn into a public argument about who owns a particular animal or cargo. Stakes, when they rise, are about honor, precedent, and who owes what to whom. Violence is rare; exclusion and bad reputation are the real threats.

## Scene Palette

Characters: a merchant loudly accusing a rival of selling adulterated salt, a Kesharat courier in rumpled official dress being laughed at by teenagers, a caravan master settling accounts and short one payment, a woman selling goat jerky and dried figs from a blanket who overhears everything, a clan elder holding court under an awning and dispensing judgments, a traveler who needs a message carried to the next settlement, a man mending a saddle and offering opinions nobody asked for, children with a basket of dust crackers and date paste running bets on a beetle race, a debtor trying to leave town before someone notices, someone's cousin who is definitely not checking whether you're worth robbing

Objects: a set of scales with clan markings and a disputed weight sitting beside them, a stack of rolled carpets or salt sacks on a cart, a brass tea set dented from travel, a jambiya in a worn sheath at a belt, a clay water jug with a wet cloth, a leather map case cracked from sun, a wind-scoured banner on a pole, flatbread and a pot of something preserved, a ledger written in the compact script of the plateau with a fresh entry crossed out, a cracked millstone repurposed as a table, dust masks hung on a hook

Sensory: heat from the ground and the sky, the smell of dust and dried dung and cardamom, wind that never stops, goat bells in the distance, the snap of canvas, shade that feels ten degrees cooler, grit between teeth, a hawk's shadow crossing the road, voices carrying on exposed stone, the long silence between gusts, hard light and long shadows

Activities: weighing goods on a portable scale while both parties watch the needle, pouring tea with ceremony, loading pack animals with salt or hides, sitting in shade waiting for the heat to break, repairing harness leather, telling a long story about clan history to someone who's heard it before, a Kesharat functionary fumbling with paperwork while locals smirk, counting coins and arguing about the exchange rate, swatting flies, marking a debt paid in a ledger with great ceremony, sorting dried goods by quality and loudly disagreeing about the grading

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a merchant accuses another of passing off low-grade salt as highland crystal and demands the player weigh in as a neutral party, a caravan driver asks the player to settle a dispute about whose mule kicked whose, a Kesharat courier tries to conscript the player as a witness for an official report that nobody else will sign
