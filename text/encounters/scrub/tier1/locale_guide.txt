# The Steppe Margins

Where the grasslands dry out and the soil turns to hardpan, the caravanserais begin. Walled oasis towns sit where the water is, connected by trade roads that are mostly just wheel ruts baked into the earth. Life here orbits around the wells and the routes between them.

The people are herders, merchants, tea house regulars, and the sorts who accumulate wherever trade passes through. Hospitality runs deep—sharing water with a traveler isn't generosity, it's law. But hospitality has limits, and everyone here is quietly keeping track of who owes what to whom.

The terrain is open, dry, and hot. Scrub brush and tough grasses, rocky outcrops, flat horizons. Shade is scarce and worth negotiating for. The wind picks up dust and doesn't stop. It's not dangerous country, just hard country, and the people in it are hard in the same way—weathered, practical, a little proud of what they put up with.

## Encounters

No monsters or bandits. The worst that happens here is a deal gone sideways or a well that's lower than expected.

Encounters should feel dry, social, and transactional. Everyone is going somewhere or selling something. Disputes are settled by negotiation, reputation, or stubbornness. When stakes are high, they're personal—pride, debt, obligation.

## Scene Palette

Characters: a tea house owner wiping cups with a rag that's dirtier than the cups, a herder moving goats across the road without urgency, a caravan driver resting in the shade of his own wagon, a merchant comparing the weight of two pouches with theatrical suspicion, a well-keeper who knows everyone's business, a courier on a fast horse who won't stop for conversation, a pilgrim headed somewhere dusty and holy, an old man mending a saddle and offering unsolicited opinions, children selling dried fruit from a basket, a woman haggling over cloth with someone who is clearly losing

Objects: a clay water jug with a wet cloth over it, a stack of rolled carpets on a cart, a brass tea set dented from travel, a string of dried peppers, a set of scales with mismatched weights, a leather map case cracked from sun, a pouch of something fragrant tied to a pack animal, a canopy rigged from poles and an old blanket, a ledger written in two languages, a cracked millstone repurposed as a table

Sensory: heat that radiates from the ground as much as the sky, the smell of dust and dried dung and cardamom, wind that never fully stops, the clatter of a tea glass on a saucer, goat bells in the distance, the snap of a canvas awning, shade that feels ten degrees cooler, the grit of sand between teeth, a hawk's shadow crossing the road, the long silence between gusts

Activities: haggling over nothing important with full intensity, pouring tea with ceremony, loading and unloading pack animals, sitting in shade waiting for the heat to break, repairing harness leather, arguing about the fastest route, refilling water skins and counting what's left, swatting flies, weighing goods on a portable scale, telling a long story to someone who's heard it before

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a merchant complains that the oasis towns are charging more for water this season, a caravan driver asks the player to settle a dispute about whose mule kicked whose, a tea house owner gossips about a recent scandal involving a well-keeper's family
