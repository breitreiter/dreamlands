The Ghosts

The passage opens into a vast chamber. Water drips somewhere in the darkness beyond your light.

She stands in a pool of white fabric - no, multiple figures, overlapping, their edges uncertain. Sometimes one, sometimes many. Tally marks cover every inch of stone around them. The scratches go up twelve feet high in places, as if clawed by someone climbing.

"You came," she says. They say. The voices layer. "Finally, you came back."

Your hand finds your weapon. The temperature drops.

"We waited. We counted every dawn through the cracks. We wrote you poems. Why did it take so long?"

The figures drift closer. You can smell limestone and old cloth and something else - desperation, maybe, or longing, faded and confused.

* Draw your weapon = Destroy this abomination and make this cave safe again

    You draw steel. The blade rings clear in the dark.

    You feel a probing presence in your mind. You do not recoil, but let it in. You show it the blood you have spilled, the men you have cut down. The ghosts are hungry, but your appetites are darker still.

    The figures recoil. The overlapping voices rise into a keening wail that echoes from every wall, multiplying, splitting into harmonics that scrape against your ears. The sound climbs higher, becomes thin, becomes nothing. The white shapes blur, their edges bleeding into shadow and stone. Then they are gone. Only silence remains, profound and absolute.

    The chamber stands empty. The tally marks remain, but whatever hand carved them has released its hold. Whatever dwelt here, whatever waited and counted and remembered, has passed beyond reach. The cave is yours now. No one need fear this darkness again.

    The cold descends like a predator's jaws. Your fingers tighten on the hilt; you draw steel, the rasp of metal loud in the dripping silence.

    The figures do not recoil. They drift nearer, their white shapes bleeding into one another, edges dissolving like fog. The temperature plummets further, a cold that reaches past your skin and settles in your bones. Your breath comes in ragged clouds. The stone beneath your boots tilts, or perhaps you tilt, your sense of direction sliding away like water through cupped hands. The torch gutters. Your grip weakens. The weapon grows heavy, impossibly heavy, and slips from nerveless fingers to clatter on stone. Darkness closes in from the edges of your vision. The layered voices murmur something you cannot parse, soft as a lullaby, mournful as a dirge.

    When you wake, you lie sprawled on sun-warmed earth outside the cave mouth. The light is wrong, shifted hours forward, the shadows long and slanting. Your limbs feel hollow, your throat parched. The cave yawns behind you, silent and patient. You rise on unsteady legs and turn your back to it. You do not look behind. You do not return.

* Flee for your life = The ghost has you confused with another. You will not die in their stead.
  You turn and plunge into the nearest passage, the ghost's layered voices rising behind you in a wail that echoes off stone. The corridor twists left, then right. Your boots strike uneven ground. Each turn opens onto another passage, each one different: one narrows until your shoulders scrape the walls, another yawns wide with columns carved from living rock, a third descends in steps worn smooth by centuries of feet.

  The air grows thick and stale. Your lungs burn. Behind you, nothing. Ahead, only deeper darkness. The passages multiply, branch, fold back on themselves. You choose by instinct, by desperation, by whatever animal sense drives fleeing things. The stone drinks your footfalls. Time stretches. Your legs weaken.

  Then, faint as a whisper: warmth on your face. You stumble forward. The passage climbs. The warmth strengthens. Light, pale and clean, spills down from somewhere above. You claw your way upward toward it, and the corridor opens onto broken sky. Sun. Wind that tastes of living things. You collapse onto grass and stone beneath the open air, chest heaving, the tomb's darkness falling away behind you like a shed skin.

* Approach with open hands = Perhaps you can reason with these spirits
  You lower your hands. "I'm listening," you say.

    The cold eases. The figures become clearer - still translucent, still overlapping, but more distinct. A young woman with dark hair. An older one with work-roughened features. A girl who couldn't have been more than sixteen.

    "We came here to dream," the dark-haired one says. "That's what the old women told us. Spend one night in the Bride's Cave, and you'll dream true. Your beloved will return. Your husband will come back. The man who promised..."

    "Marta was first," another voice. "Sixty years ago, maybe more. We found her marks when we came. We thought - we thought they meant the ritual worked."

    "I came in winter," says the girl. Sixteen, you think. Maybe younger. "The passages flooded. I could hear the water rising but I couldn't find the way back. I counted twenty-three days."

    They speak over each other now, a dozen voices.

    *I was left at the altar, my father wouldn't take me back—*

    *He took my dowry and disappeared, I had nothing—*

    *The old women said it was ancient magic, older than the village—*

    *I wrote him poems, thinking he would feel them somehow—*

    *We counted the days. We thought someone would notice—*

    The dark-haired woman—Marta, perhaps—steps forward. "The village finally sealed it. But by then we were already here. Already waiting. Already..."

    She gestures at the tally marks climbing the walls.

    "We thought you were someone coming to find us. We always think that." Her smile is unbearably sad. "But you listened. That's... that's something."

    The cold has become almost comfortable now. One of them presses something into your palm - you feel its weight, though her fingers pass through yours like mist.

    "Remember us," they say together, then disperse, like mist in daylight.

    You spread your hands wide, showing empty palms to the drifting forms. The figures halt their advance, their edges rippling like cloth underwater. For a moment the chamber falls silent save for the eternal drip of water against stone.

    Then the voices return, no longer layered but speaking in turns, overlapping, cutting across one another. "This is not the one." A pause, a shifting of pale fabric. "Someone different. Someone new." The temperature plunges further. Your breath mists before your face. The tallest figure leans forward, and you glimpse where face should be only deeper shadow. "Leave," they intone, and the word carries the weight of stone grinding upon stone. "Leave while you still have life in you."

    You take a step backward. The figures do not follow. They stand motionless, watching, waiting. "Come not back," the voices whisper, "lest you try our patience." The words hang in the cold air long after you turn and make your way toward the passage. Behind you, the scratching begins again—slow, deliberate, counting something only they can measure. You emerge into the corridor beyond, unharmed in body but carrying the chill of that place in your bones, uncertain what manner of grief or madness you have witnessed.
