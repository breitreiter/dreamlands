# The Bride's Cave

**Biome:** Plains  
**Tier:** 1 (Safe)

## Description

A limestone cave system boarded up by the nearest village after a string of disappearances. The locals say a woman in white lures travelers inside. The cave walls are covered in scratched tally marks and love poetry in no known language.

The folk practice: An old wives' tale that if a woman who's been spurned, left at the altar, or desperate for marriage spends a night alone in the Bride's Cave, she'll dream of her true love and he'll be compelled to return/appear/marry her.
The reality: The cave is a fucking maze. Easy to get disoriented, especially by candlelight. Multiple chambers, false exits, limestone formations that all look the same. The deeper sections flood seasonally. You go in alone at dusk for the ritual, fully intending to leave at dawn, but you take one wrong turn...
The progression over decades:

First woman dies (accident, truly lost)
Her poetry/tally marks are found by the next desperate woman, who thinks they're part of the ritual - proof it works!
This actually encourages more women to come
Each death adds more "evidence" that the cave is powerful
By the time people connect the disappearances to the cave, there are already many dead
Village boards it up, but the damage is done

The tally marks: Not counting victims - counting days waiting for rescue, or counting days until "the magic works," or counting days of prayer. Same difference when you're starving in the dark.
The love poetry: Their ritual verses, their prayers, their desperate last words. All in different hands because it's different women over 40-50 years.
