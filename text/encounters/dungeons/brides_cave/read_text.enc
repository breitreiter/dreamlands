A Record in Stone
You run your fingers along the etchings, the marks damp and ragged.

Love oaths. Prayers. Names unknown to you. The script shifts every few paces. Fine calligraphy, jagged scrawls, deep gouges hacked by frantic hands. A few catch your eye.

*Alain, you swore by the harvest moon. I kneel where the stone drinks tears and lay your name before the deep. If the spirits hear, let them turn you. If they do not, let them judge you as they judge me.*

*Matthis, I have brought your token and my last candle. The flame gutters, yet I keep vigil. Let the dark teach you constancy. Let it scour from you the forgetfulness that has made this cavern my only witness.*

Tally marks stand ranked in columns. Five-bar gates repeat by the hundreds, scored hard into the stone.

  } @else {
    The passages twist. Your light catches familiar scratches on the wall - wait, did you pass this already? The chambers echo with your footsteps, then echo again, differently. You wander through the night, lost and exhausted, until all at once the passageway opens to a cave deep underground.
