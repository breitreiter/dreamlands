The Bride's Cave
Your torch casts its glow upon a cathedral of stone. Light strikes wall and stalagmite, crawls across the floor, and reveals words carved into every span of rock. 

Passageways wind away in all directions.

The air hangs cold and unmoving.

* Venture deeper into the cave = Pick a passage and see where it leads

    The passages twist. Your light catches familiar scratches on the wall - wait, did you pass this already? The chambers echo with your footsteps, then echo again, differently. You wander through the night, lost and exhausted, until all at once the passageway opens to a cave deep underground.

* Examine the writing = Perhaps it is a clue. Or perhaps knowledge better left unknown.
