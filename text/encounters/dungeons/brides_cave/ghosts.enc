The passage opens into a vast chamber. Water drips somewhere in the darkness beyond your light.

She stands in a pool of white fabric - no, multiple figures, overlapping, their edges uncertain. Sometimes one, sometimes many. Tally marks cover every inch of stone around them. The scratches go up twelve feet high in places, as if clawed by someone climbing.

"You came," she says. They say. The voices layer. "Finally, you came back."

Your hand finds your weapon. The temperature drops.

"We waited. We counted every dawn through the cracks. We wrote you poems. Why did it take so long?"

The figures drift closer. You can smell limestone and old cloth and something else - desperation, maybe, or longing, faded and confused.

* Flee for your life = The ghost has you confused with another. You will not die in their stead.
  FIXME: you run through a maze of twisting passages, all different. when you are nearly out of hope, sunlight and safety.

* Approach with open hands = Perhaps you can reason with these spirits
  You lower your hands. "I'm listening," you say.

    The cold eases. The figures become clearer - still translucent, still overlapping, but more distinct. A young woman with dark hair. An older one with work-roughened features. A girl who couldn't have been more than sixteen.

    "We came here to dream," the dark-haired one says. "That's what the old women told us. Spend one night in the Bride's Cave, and you'll dream true. Your beloved will return. Your husband will come back. The man who promised..."

    "Marta was first," another voice. "Sixty years ago, maybe more. We found her marks when we came. We thought - we thought they meant the ritual worked."

    "I came in winter," says the girl. Sixteen, you think. Maybe younger. "The passages flooded. I could hear the water rising but I couldn't find the way back. I counted twenty-three days."

    They speak over each other now, a dozen voices.

    *I was left at the altar, my father wouldn't take me back—*

    *He took my dowry and disappeared, I had nothing—*

    *The old women said it was ancient magic, older than the village—*

    *I wrote him poems, thinking he would feel them somehow—*

    *We counted the days. We thought someone would notice—*

    The dark-haired woman—Marta, perhaps—steps forward. "The village finally sealed it. But by then we were already here. Already waiting. Already..."

    She gestures at the tally marks climbing the walls.

    "We thought you were someone coming to find us. We always think that." Her smile is unbearably sad. "But you listened. That's... that's something."

    The cold has become almost comfortable now. One of them presses something into your palm - you feel its weight, though her fingers pass through yours like mist.

    "Remember us," they say together, then disperse, like mist in daylight.

    FIXME: "this is not the one. someone different. someone new. leave. leave while you still have life in you. come not back, lest you try our patience." You leave, unharmed, but uncertain what you have witnessed.
