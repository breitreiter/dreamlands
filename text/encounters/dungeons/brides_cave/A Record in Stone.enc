A Record in Stone

You run your fingers along the etchings, the marks damp and ragged.

Love oaths. Prayers. Names unknown to you. The script shifts every few paces. Fine calligraphy, jagged scrawls, deep gouges hacked by frantic hands. A few catch your eye.

Some passages end mid-sentence, the final letter trailing off into nothing. Others overlap, newer words carved atop old, layer upon layer of desperate testimony.

*Alain, you swore by the harvest moon. I kneel where the stone drinks tears and lay your name before the deep. If the spirits hear, let them turn you. If they do not, let them judge you as they judge me.*

*Matthis, I have brought your token and my last candle. The flame gutters, yet I keep vigil. Let the dark teach you constancy. Let it scour from you the forgetfulness that has made this cavern my only witness.*

You find a name, inscribed a hundred times over. Messages to family. Regrets for things not said, mistakes, misdeeds. Tally marks stand ranked in columns. Five-bar gates repeat by the hundreds, scored hard into the stone.

* Flee this cursed place = Run before whatever wrote these oaths finds you
  You pull your hand from the stone. The damp clings to your fingertips. Behind you the wall stretches away into shadow, scored with its litany of grief and longing, but you have read enough.

  Your boots find purchase on the uneven floor. You move quickly, not running, not yet, but with purpose. The echoes of your passage scatter into the dark. The weight of those inscriptions presses at your back, a hundred voices crying out in silence, but you do not turn to answer them. Whatever drove those hands to carve and scrape and plead may still linger in these depths. You have no wish to join their testimony.

  The passage narrows ahead. You slip through, and the inscribed wall falls behind you. Your breath comes easier. The dark remains, but it is merely dark now, empty of names and numbers and the memory of desperate fingers working stone.

* Venture deeper into the cave = Pick a passage and see where it leads

    You choose a passage and press inward, ducking beneath a low overhang where moisture drips in slow rhythm. The stone walls close around you, ridged and uneven, forcing you to turn sideways in places where the path narrows to a fissure. Your boots scrape over grit and loose pebbles.

    The first tunnel branches without warning. You take the left fork, follow it for twenty paces, and find it ending at a blank face of limestone. You retrace your steps, breathing the stale air, and try the right. This one twists sharply, doubles back on itself, and deposits you at a chamber you passed moments before. The same etchings mark the wall: tally marks in clusters, a name repeated until the stone wore smooth beneath the chisel. You pause, run your palm along the surface, and note the subtle downward slope of the floor. Water seeks the depths. You follow its course.

    The logic reveals itself in fragments. Passages that slant upward lead nowhere. Those that descend branch often, but the lowest path always continues. You trace this thread through three more turns, past alcoves cluttered with offerings gone to rot and rust. The air grows heavier, thick with the scent of damp earth and something older, something that clings to the back of your throat. The walls widen. The ceiling lifts away into shadow. You emerge at last into the innermost cavern, its vastness swallowing the meager light, its silence broken only by the slow drip of water from heights unseen.

    The passages twist. Your light catches familiar scratches on the wall - wait, did you pass this already? The chambers echo with your footsteps, then echo again, differently. You wander through the night, lost and exhausted, until all at once the passageway opens to a cave deep underground.
