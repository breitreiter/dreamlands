# Redoubt of the Mire Baron

**Biome:** Swamp  
**Tier:** 2-4 (Frontier to Dark Places)

## Description

A robber-lord built his stronghold on what he was told was solid ground. It wasn't. The keep has canted thirty degrees into the bog, creating a disorienting funhouse of tilted corridors and flooded lower chambers. The Baron adapted. His descendants have adapted further.
