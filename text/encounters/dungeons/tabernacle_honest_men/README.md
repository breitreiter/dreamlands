# The Tabernacle of Honest Men

**Biome:** Mountains  
**Tier:** 2-4 (Frontier to Dark Places)

## Description

A stone chapel on the mountain run by a small order of monks who have taken a vow of absolute truth. This sounds admirable until you realize their truth includes things mortals shouldn't know, and prolonged exposure to their sermons produces nosebleeds, nightmares, and prophecy.
