# Submersion of Saint Evarre

**Biome:** Swamp  
**Tier:** 4 (Dark Places)

## Description

A chapel to a martyred holy woman, sinking an inch a year for centuries. The nave is waist-deep in black water. Pilgrims say her uncorrupted body still lies behind the altar, but what's down there isn't uncorrupted and it isn't her.
