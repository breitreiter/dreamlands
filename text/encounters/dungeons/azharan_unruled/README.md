# Azharan, the Unruled

**Biome:** Hills  
**Tier:** 2-3 (Frontier to Wildlands)

## Description

A city of red sandstone, perfectly preserved, utterly empty. Every building is unlocked. Every table is set for a meal. In the central plaza, a throne sits empty, and anyone who sits in it hears a voice offering them dominion over a kingdom of dust.
