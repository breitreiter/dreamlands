# The Fever Palace

**Biome:** Swamp  
**Tier:** 2-4 (Frontier to Dark Places)

## Description

Once a forest retreat for the nobles of a lost civilization, now calcified with mineral deposits and half-reclaimed by the swamp. Inside, the revelers are still reveling — gaunt, hollow-eyed, dancing to music only they hear, and they'd love for you to join them.
