# The Pallid Court

**Biome:** Forest  
**Tier:** 4 (Dark Places)

## Description

A palace of white marble now furred with moss and lichen so thick it breathes. Within, an immortal queen holds revels for courtiers who are merely well-preserved corpses animated by the fungal network threading their bones.
