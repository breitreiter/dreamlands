# Fort Contrition

**Biome:** Swamp  
**Tier:** 1-2 (Safe to Frontier)

## Description

An imperial outpost built to "civilize" the swamp, now half-submerged and listing badly. The garrison's final dispatches describe the walls sweating, the swamp coming up through the floorboards, and the sound of something massive turning over beneath them.
