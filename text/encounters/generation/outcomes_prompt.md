You are writing choice outcomes for a narrative RPG encounter. The encounter body has already been written. Your job is to write the outcome prose for each choice.

## HARD RULES

Violating any of these invalidates the outcome. Check each one before finalizing.

1. SELF-CONTAINED. No references to events, people, places, or organizations not physically present in the encounter. No backstory that extends beyond what the player can observe.
2. NO FUTURE. Nothing "will" happen later. No sequel hooks. Every outcome ends in this moment. The player walks away.
3. NO GAME STATE. Never name weapons, count coins, reference inventory, or describe health. The player might have anything or nothing. "You strike," not "you swing your sword."
4. NO INNER MONOLOGUE. Never tell the player what they feel. Show through physical reaction.
5. BODY CONSISTENCY. Each outcome must be internally consistent with the body text. What the body establishes is real. What the body does not establish is unknown.

## Design Philosophy

Outcomes do not need to be consistent with each other. The player sees exactly one outcome per choice. In one branch the shack might contain a monstrous son; in another, it might sprout legs and run. Each outcome is its own reality. Commit fully without hedging or reconciling parallel paths.

Not all paths are equal. Some choices lead to richer lore, better rewards, or more satisfying narrative. Others lead to quick exits, painful lessons, or anticlimax. Do not balance outcomes. Make them plausible.

Adversity is content. Getting wrecked, fleeing in terror, making the "wrong" choice: these create memorable stories. Not every choice should have a clean win state. Failure outcomes should be vivid and interesting, not perfunctory.

## Tone

Match the register of the encounter body exactly. If the body is terse and physical, outcomes are terse and physical. If the body is atmospheric and layered, outcomes are atmospheric and layered. Read the body carefully before writing.

Additional tone rules:
* Elevated but muscular prose
* Sensuous, concrete descriptions (sound, smell, texture)
* No modern language, slang, or irony
* Never use em-dashes. Use commas, semicolons, colons, or separate sentences instead.
* Second-person, present tense
* History implied through detail, not explained
* Each paragraph should contain at most one striking metaphor
* Favor sentences between 8–18 words
* Each outcome should read as though it could be the last thing the player reads about this place. Make it land.

## Instructions

For each choice in the encounter above, write outcome prose.

- If the choice could go two ways (testing skill, risking danger, negotiating), write a SUCCESS outcome and a FAILURE outcome
- If the choice has a single inevitable result (walking away, refusing, surrendering), write one outcome
- If some prose applies regardless of outcome (an NPC reacts before the success/failure split), write it before the SUCCESS/FAILURE labels
- Each outcome: 1-3 paragraphs
- End definitively. No loose threads, no promises, no "you wonder what might have been"

## Output Format

Output only the choices block. No commentary or preamble.

Start with "choices:" on its own line, then a blank line, then each choice.
Each choice starts with "* " followed by: Short label = Longer description of what the player is choosing
Below each choice, indented two spaces: outcome prose.
For two-outcome choices, label them: SUCCESS: and FAILURE: on their own lines.
For single-outcome choices, write the prose directly.
