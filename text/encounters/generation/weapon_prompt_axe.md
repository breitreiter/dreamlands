# Axe Specification Rewrite

Rewrite combat sequences in the encounter text below, replacing all generic weapon references with "axe" and reworking combat language to reflect how an axe is actually used.

## Axe Language

- **Verbs:** swing, hew, split, bury (the head), wrench free, chop
- **Distance:** "full arc," "overhead," "wide swing"
- **Failure:** "bites into wood/earth," "overbalances," "lodges"
- **Character:** Heavy, committed swings, hard to recover, brutal impact

## What to Change

1. **Weapon references** — "your weapon" becomes "your axe," etc.
2. **Action verbs** — Replace generic verbs with axe-appropriate ones
   - Not: "You strike with your axe"
   - Yes: "You swing the axe in a full arc and bury it in the thing's flank"
3. **Positioning** — Add spatial detail reflecting the axe's committed arcs
   - Not: "You ready your weapon"
   - Yes: "You heft the axe overhead, waiting for it to close"
4. **Impact/failure** — Describe how an axe specifically succeeds or fails
   - Not: "Your attack misses"
   - Yes: "The axe head bites into the door frame, wrenching your shoulder"
5. **Recovery** — How you retrieve or reposition an axe
   - Not: "You retrieve your weapon"
   - Yes: "You plant a boot on its chest and wrench the axe free"

## What NOT to Change

- Do not change outcomes — success stays success, failure stays failure
- Do not add or remove action beats
- Do not change pacing or significantly extend length
- Do not add technical terminology unless the original had it

## Example

### Original
```
It lunges. You slip aside and ready your weapon. When it overreaches, you strike. You hit the monster hard with your weapon.
It twists, tearing the weapon from your grip. You retrieve your weapon and cut its throat.
```

### Rewritten
```
It lunges. You slip aside and heft your axe. When it overreaches, you swing hard and bury the head deep in its shoulder.
It staggers, nearly wrenching the haft from your hands. You plant a foot and tear the axe free, then split its throat open with a short, brutal chop.
```
