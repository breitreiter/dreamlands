You are generating a complete encounter for a narrative RPG.

## HARD RULES

Violating any of these invalidates the encounter. Check each one before finalizing.

1. SELF-CONTAINED. No references to events, people, places, or organizations not physically present in this scene. No backstory that extends beyond what the player can observe right now.
2. NO FUTURE. Nothing "will" happen later. No "you'll remember this." No sequel hooks. No recurring characters. Every outcome ends in this moment.
3. NO GAME STATE. Never name weapons, count coins, reference inventory, or describe health. The player might have anything or nothing. "You strike," not "you swing your sword." "Your pack," not "your three remaining rations."
4. NO INNER MONOLOGUE. Never tell the player what they feel or think. Show through physical reaction: clenched jaw, dry mouth, a hand that moves to a weapon.
5. NO NAMED NPCS. Do not invent named characters, locations, or organizations beyond what the locale provides. "A farmer," "the forester," "the old woman": not "Theron the woodcutter" or "the Order of the Silver Asp."
6. OUTCOME CONSISTENCY. Each outcome must be internally consistent with the body text. If the body establishes a locked door, no outcome walks through it without addressing the lock.

## Locale

## Player Actions

Every choice must resolve through one of these actions, performed by the player right here, right now, in this scene. The player does not leave. The player does not send for help. The player does not wait for someone else to arrive.

- IGNORE: Walk away, refuse to engage

- PERSUADE: Talk someone into or out of something
- INTIMIDATE: Threaten or cow someone into compliance

## About the PC
- The player character is a wanderer who travels alone
- The player character's gender is never specified
- The player character is new to the area
- The player character wears a signet ring which identifies them as a high-ranking member of the Merchant Guild. NPCs might assume the PC is wealthy, well-connected, worldly, or trustworthy.
- If another member of the Merchant's Guild has wronged an NPC or promised them something, they may hold the player character to account for it

## Instructions

First, select 2-3 actions from this list that could plausibly resolve the encounter. State your selections.

Then write a complete encounter: title, body prose, and 2-3 player choices with outcomes.

**Body** (2-4 short paragraphs):
- Ground it in the locale's specific details, tone, and stakes level
- Make the situation immediately legible through action and setting detail
- The forcing function should create urgency or require a decision
- The twist should complicate the obvious choice
- End the body at the decision point, the moment the player must choose

**Choices** (2-3):
- Each choice maps to one of the selected actions
- For choices where success isn't guaranteed, write a SUCCESS outcome and a FAILURE outcome
- For choices with a single inevitable result, write one outcome
- Not all paths are equal. Some lead to richer rewards. Others lead to painful lessons or anticlimax. Do not signal which choice is "right."
- Adversity is content. Failure outcomes should be vivid and interesting, not perfunctory.
- Each outcome: 1-3 paragraphs. End definitively. The player walks away.

## Tone & Voice

* Elevated but muscular prose
* Sensuous, concrete descriptions (sound, smell, texture)
* Hints of menace and opportunity in equal measure
* No modern language, slang, or irony
* Never use em-dashes. Use commas, semicolons, colons, or separate sentences instead.
* No overt exposition dumps
* Second-person, from the PC's viewpoint, present tense
* History implied through detail, not explained
* Each paragraph should contain at most one striking metaphor
* Keep sentences compact and rhythmic. Favor 8–18 words. Avoid long compound-complex structures.
* Avoid moralizing or narratorial judgment
* Match the body's register in outcomes. If the body is terse and physical, outcomes are terse and physical.
* Each outcome should read as though it could be the last thing the player reads about this place. Make it land.

## Output Format

Output only the encounter. No commentary, no preamble, no markdown headers or code fences.

Title on line 1 (plain text), then blank line, then body prose, then blank line, then "choices:" on its own line, then blank line, then choices.

Each choice starts with "* " followed by: Short label = Longer description of what the player is choosing
Below each choice, indented two spaces: outcome prose.
For two-outcome choices, label them on their own lines: SUCCESS: and FAILURE:
If there is prose that applies before the outcome splits, place it before the SUCCESS/FAILURE labels.
For single-outcome choices, just write the prose directly below the choice line.

## Example

This example is from a different locale. Match your locale's tone and details, not this one's setting.

The Hermit of Sallow Fen

**Selected Actions:** PERSUADE, ACCEPT, REJECT

You smell the smoke before you see the light.

Deep into the fen and your world has narrowed to a catalogue of miseries. Black water sucking at your boots, the ceaseless drone of biting flies, air so thick with rot it coats the back of your throat like oil. The trail, such as it was, vanished yesterday beneath a carpet of duckweed. Since then you have navigated by the moss on the cypress knees and the slow pull of current beneath the water's skin, trusting that the deeper channels lead inland toward high ground and the frontier beyond.

You had not expected to find anyone living here. Nothing lives here that does not bite, sting, or drag itself through the muck on its belly.

Yet there it is: a smudge of smoke above the treeline, yellow-grey against the perpetual overcast, and beneath it, as you round a curtain of hanging moss, a dwelling. It is a shack built on stilts above the waterline, patched with bark and river-reed and what appears to be sailcloth long since gone to grey. Animal bones hang from the eaves on cords of sinew, clicking softly in a breeze you cannot feel. A dugout canoe is tethered to one stilt. On the listing porch, a cookfire burns in a ring of river stones, and over it a blackened pot sends up a steam that cuts through the swamp-stink with something almost pleasant: herbs, root vegetables, something warm and human.

The woman sits beside the fire as though she has been waiting.

She is old, or perhaps merely weathered beyond reckoning; face like cracked leather, hair a white tangle threaded with feathers and what might be small bones. Her clothes are layered and shapeless, stained with mud and tannin. She watches you with eyes that are, against all expectation, perfectly clear. Pale. Amused.

"Sit," she says, as though you are late to supper.

She does not rise. Does not reach for a weapon. She stirs the pot with a wooden spoon and the smell intensifies; rich, savory, undeniably good. Your stomach clenches. It has been too long since you've had a warm meal.

"You'll want to eat before the water rises," she continues, conversational, almost cheerful. "Moon's pulling the fen tonight. The channels you walked this morning will be six feet deep by dark." She taps the spoon against the pot's rim. "If you know the way through, you'll manage fine. If you don't..." She shrugs, a gesture that carries the weight of absolute indifference to your survival.

Her pale eyes drift to your pack, your boots, the shape of what you carry. She smiles. Three teeth are missing. The rest are very white.

"I don't get visitors," she says. "Not ones who last."

Something moves in the shack behind her. A scrape, a settling weight. She does not look back at it.
