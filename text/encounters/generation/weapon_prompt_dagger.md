# Dagger Specification Rewrite

Rewrite combat sequences in the encounter text below, replacing all generic weapon references with "dagger" and reworking combat language to reflect how a dagger is actually used.

## Dagger Language

- **Verbs:** draw, dart, drive, stab, slash, drag (the edge), embed, wrench free
- **Distance:** "inside their guard," "close enough to," "grappling distance"
- **Failure:** "skitters across," "finds no purchase," "deflects off"
- **Character:** Quick, desperate, requires proximity, easily lost in struggle

## What to Change

1. **Weapon references** — "your weapon" becomes "your dagger," etc.
2. **Action verbs** — Replace generic verbs with dagger-appropriate ones
   - Not: "You strike with your dagger"
   - Yes: "You drive the dagger between its ribs"
3. **Positioning** — Add spatial detail reflecting the dagger's short reach
   - Not: "You ready your weapon"
   - Yes: "You dart inside its guard, dagger low"
4. **Impact/failure** — Describe how a dagger specifically succeeds or fails
   - Not: "Your attack misses"
   - Yes: "The blade skitters across bone, finding no purchase"
5. **Recovery** — How you retrieve or reposition a dagger
   - Not: "You retrieve your weapon"
   - Yes: "You snatch the fallen dagger from the mud"

## What NOT to Change

- Do not change outcomes — success stays success, failure stays failure
- Do not add or remove action beats
- Do not change pacing or significantly extend length
- Do not add technical fencing terminology unless the original had it

## Example

### Original
```
It lunges. You slip aside and ready your weapon. When it overreaches, you strike. You hit the monster hard with your weapon.
It twists, tearing the weapon from your grip. You retrieve your weapon and cut its throat.
```

### Rewritten
```
It lunges. You slip aside and draw your dagger. When it overreaches, you dart inside its guard and drive the blade up between its ribs.
It thrashes, wrenching the embedded steel from your grip. You snatch the fallen dagger from the mud and drag the edge across its throat—one swift, desperate stroke.
```
