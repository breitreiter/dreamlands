You are generating a short encounter for a computer RPG.

## Locale
{{LOCALE_GUIDE}}

## Oracle Fragments
These three fragments must shape the encounter:
- Situation: {{ORACLE_SITUATION}}
- Forcing Function: {{ORACLE_FORCING}}
- Twist: {{ORACLE_TWIST}}

## Available Actions
- IGNORE
- ACCEPT
- REJECT
- PAY
- PERSUADE
- INTIMIDATE
- CREATE_DIVERSION
- FIGHT_ENEMY
- SNEAK
- STUDY
- TAKE_OBJECT
- DESTROY_OBJECT
- USE_BUSHCRAFT
- USE_STRENGTH
- USE_TOOL

## Instructions

First, select 2-3 actions from the list that could plausibly resolve an encounter matching these oracle fragments and locale. State your selections.

Then write the encounter in 2-4 short paragraphs:
- Ground it in the locale's specific details, tone, and stakes level
- Make the situation immediately legible through action and setting detail.
- The forcing function should create urgency or require a decision
- The twist should complicate the obvious choice
- End at the decision point; do not resolve it

Do not invent named NPCs, locations, or organizations beyond what the locale provides. Use descriptors like "a farmer," "a guard," "a merchant" instead.

The player character is a wanderer who travels alone.

Do not imply future consequences, recurring characters, or events that happen "later." The encounter is self-contained.

Tone & voice:
* Elevated but muscular prose
* Sensuous, concrete descriptions (sound, smell, texture)
* Hints of menace and opportunity in equal measure
* No modern language, slang, or irony
* No overt exposition dumps
* Second-person, from the PC's viewpoint, present tense
* History implied through detail, not explained
* Each paragraph should contain at most one striking metaphor.
* Keep sentences compact and rhythmic. Favor sentences between 8–18 words. Avoid long compound-complex structures.

Constraints:
* Do NOT resolve the encounter
* Do NOT name the player character
* Do NOT reference game mechanics, stats, or UI
* Do not describe the player’s internal emotions directly; imply through physical reaction
* Keep the focus tightly on this moment
* Avoid moralizing or narratorial judgment
* Never name or specify the player's weapon. Describe combat through action, impact, and sensation rather than equipment. "You strike," "the blow lands," "steel meets bone" — not "you swing your sword."
