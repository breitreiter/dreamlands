# Spear Specification Rewrite

Rewrite combat sequences in the encounter text below, replacing all generic weapon references with "spear" and reworking combat language to reflect how a spear is actually used.

## Spear Language

- **Verbs:** thrust, jab, keep at bay, drive forward, withdraw, brace
- **Distance:** "spear's length," "at arm's reach," "beyond their grasp"
- **Failure:** "tip skids off," "shaft snaps," "caught and held"
- **Character:** Reach advantage, defensive, thrust-focused, vulnerable if closed on

## What to Change

1. **Weapon references** — "your weapon" becomes "your spear," etc.
2. **Action verbs** — Replace generic verbs with spear-appropriate ones
   - Not: "You strike with your spear"
   - Yes: "You drive the spear point through its guard and into its chest"
3. **Positioning** — Add spatial detail reflecting the spear's reach advantage
   - Not: "You ready your weapon"
   - Yes: "You level the spear, keeping it at bay"
4. **Impact/failure** — Describe how a spear specifically succeeds or fails
   - Not: "Your attack misses"
   - Yes: "The tip skids off its hide and you stumble forward"
5. **Recovery** — How you retrieve or reposition a spear
   - Not: "You retrieve your weapon"
   - Yes: "You brace a foot and withdraw the spear with a wet wrench"

## What NOT to Change

- Do not change outcomes — success stays success, failure stays failure
- Do not add or remove action beats
- Do not change pacing or significantly extend length
- Do not add technical terminology unless the original had it

## Example

### Original
```
It lunges. You slip aside and ready your weapon. When it overreaches, you strike. You hit the monster hard with your weapon.
It twists, tearing the weapon from your grip. You retrieve your weapon and cut its throat.
```

### Rewritten
```
It lunges. You slip aside and level your spear. When it overreaches, you thrust hard and drive the point deep into its ribs.
It thrashes, nearly tearing the shaft from your hands. You wrench the spear free and jab it through the throat before it can recover.
```
