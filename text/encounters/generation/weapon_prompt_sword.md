# Sword Specification Rewrite

Rewrite combat sequences in the encounter text below, replacing all generic weapon references with "sword" and reworking combat language to reflect how a sword is actually used.

## Sword Language

- **Verbs:** draw, strike, parry, cut, cleave, thrust, ward off
- **Distance:** "blade's reach," "circling," "finding an opening"
- **Failure:** "turned aside by," "catches on," "glances off"
- **Character:** Balanced, measured, requires space, controlled

## What to Change

1. **Weapon references** — "your weapon" becomes "your sword," etc.
2. **Action verbs** — Replace generic verbs with sword-appropriate ones
   - Not: "You attack with your sword"
   - Yes: "You step in and cleave deep into its shoulder"
3. **Positioning** — Add spatial detail reflecting the sword's mid-range reach
   - Not: "You ready your weapon"
   - Yes: "You draw your sword and settle into guard"
4. **Impact/failure** — Describe how a sword specifically succeeds or fails
   - Not: "Your attack misses"
   - Yes: "The blade catches on its hide and glances off"
5. **Recovery** — How you retrieve or reposition a sword
   - Not: "You retrieve your weapon"
   - Yes: "You wrench the blade free and step back into guard"

## What NOT to Change

- Do not change outcomes — success stays success, failure stays failure
- Do not add or remove action beats
- Do not change pacing or significantly extend length
- Do not add technical fencing terminology unless the original had it

## Example

### Original
```
It lunges. You slip aside and ready your weapon. When it overreaches, you strike. You hit the monster hard with your weapon.
It twists, tearing the weapon from your grip. You retrieve your weapon and cut its throat.
```

### Rewritten
```
It lunges. You slip aside and draw your sword. When it overreaches, you step in and cleave deep into its shoulder.
It reels, nearly tearing the blade from your hands. You wrench it free and put the edge through its throat in one controlled stroke.
```
