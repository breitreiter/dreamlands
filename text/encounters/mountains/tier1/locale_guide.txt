# The Near Ranges

Where mountains meet settled land, there are mining towns, trading posts, and high pastures. The roads climb and switchback but they're maintained—mostly. Mule trains haul ore down and supplies up. The air thins a little, the nights get colder, and the views open up in ways that make flatland travelers stop and stare.

People up here are practical, weather-hardened, and a little proud of it. Miners, teamsters, shepherds grazing highland flocks, innkeepers who charge too much because they can. Everyone knows the mountains get worse further out, and everyone has an opinion about exactly where "out there" becomes "too far."

Water is reliable—snowmelt feeds the streams most of the year. Timber is available at lower elevations. The terrain is the main challenge: steep grades, loose rock, and weather that changes fast. None of it is deadly if you're paying attention.

## Encounters

No monsters. Rockslides, bad weather, and the occasional belligerent mule are the main hazards. People here are too busy working to cause much trouble, though claim disputes between miners get heated.

Encounters should feel industrious and uphill. Everyone is going somewhere with a load on their back. Problems are logistical—a blocked pass, a lame pack animal, a bridge that washed out.

## Scene Palette

Characters: a muleteer swearing at a stubborn animal, a miner with dust-caked everything, a toll collector who's heard every excuse, a shepherd moving a flock across the trail, a surveyor with too many instruments, a merchant waiting out weather at a waystation, a smith repairing tools at a trailside forge, a courier moving fast and saying little, a group of miners playing cards outside a shaft, an innkeeper diluting the beer

Objects: a pickaxe with a cracked handle, a string of pack mules roped together, ore samples in a leather pouch, a hand-drawn claim map, a toll gate that's just a rope and a stool, a cairn marking a trail junction, a broken wagon wheel propped against a rock, a tin cup chained to a spring, a battered lantern, a ledger full of weights and tallies

Sensory: wind that cuts even in sun, the clang of metal on rock echoing off a cliff face, thin air you notice on the steep parts, gravel crunching underfoot, the smell of pine pitch and cold stone, meltwater running fast and clear, a hawk circling overhead, the distant rumble of a rockfall that's probably fine, woodsmoke from a mining camp, silence between gusts that feels enormous

Activities: hauling cargo uphill, negotiating passage fees, waiting for weather to break, reinforcing a trail edge with stones, heating soup over a small fire, arguing about the quality of a vein, reading the sky for storms, watering animals at a trough, repairing gear with cold-stiff hands, pointing at a distant peak and telling a story about it

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a muleteer needs help getting a cart unstuck on a switchback, a miner offers to share his fire and his opinions, a toll collector tries to charge an obviously inflated fee
