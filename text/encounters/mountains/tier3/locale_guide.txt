The Hollow Karst
Low, ugly mountains riddled with sinkholes and cave systems that go deeper than the geology should allow. There's nothing here worth claiming — no ore, no pasture, no timber, no strategic value — which is exactly why whatever lives inside has been undisturbed for so long. Herder clans use a dozen euphemisms to avoid speaking its name. Imperial miners who broke through into the deeper chambers found tools older than their empire, arranged neatly, as if someone had just stepped out. Production quotas were never met. The miners started working at night, then stopped sleeping, then stopped being miners.
