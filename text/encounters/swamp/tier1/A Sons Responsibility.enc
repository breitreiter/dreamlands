A Son's Responsibility

The dike is failing. You see it from the raised path — a seeping dark line where the packed earth has begun to weep, water forcing through in thin streams that catch the afternoon light. Beyond it, the paddy fields stretch in careful geometric rows, rice stalks still green, weeks from harvest. A woman stands knee-deep in the breach, packing mud with her bare hands. Her movements are methodical but losing ground. The water wants through.

She doesn't look up when you approach, but she knows you're there. "My son left this morning," she says, voice flat as the water. "Took the boat. Said he'd be back before the tide pressed in." She shoves another handful of clay into the widening gap. It holds for three heartbeats, then a fresh trickle carves through. "He won't be. This is the third time." 

You watch the woman work, and you think you have the gist of it. Cut reeds, bind them with clay, drive stakes into the ground to hold work. With both you you, it would take an hour, maybe less. But the woman's hands pause and she finally meets your eyes.

"I can't let just let the dike wash away, but he needs to see it fail."

The words carry no heat, only weight. "He needs to come back to ash and mud and understand there are consequences." 

A heron lifts from the far paddies, wingbeats heavy in the thick air.

The dike gives a little more. The first paddy will flood soon.

* Help in silence = Just repair the dike and prevent a flood
  You step off the path and the water takes you to mid-thigh, warm and thick with silt. The woman watches as you begin to gather materials. Clay from the solid bank, handfuls of reed stems still green enough to bend, the long-bladed sedge that holds knots. You work in silence, weaving fascia between driven stakes, packing the gaps with clay mixed thick with chopped stems. The woman stands aside. She doesn't help. She watches the way someone watches a meal being prepared for a guest they didn't invite.

  The breach holds. You pack the last of the clay smooth, reinforcing the weak points with twisted reed bundles that will swell as they soak. The seeping stops. The paddies remain flat and green, undisturbed. The woman looks at the repair for a long moment, then at the distance where the boat will eventually return. "You've bought him another season of thinking he can leave whenever he wants," she says. There's no gratitude in it. She turns and walks toward the hut, feet sure on the raised path, and doesn't look back. You stand alone by the dike, hands caked with drying mud.

    You step off the path and the water takes you to mid-thigh, warm and thick with silt. The woman watches as you begin to gather materials. "What's your name?" you ask. "Netta." "And your boy?" She sighs. "Wren." You grab two handfuls of clay from the solid bank. "What's Wren gotten himself into this time?"
    
    Netta steps back from the breach. Not far—just enough that her hands are no longer sealing it. She watches the water claim its ground, jaw set hard enough to hurt. “He thinks I'm trying to keep him small,” she says. “Keep him stuck on this farm.” The words come rougher now. “But this is what I know. This is what keeps us fed. If he leaves it, I don't know how to follow.”

    Another shudder runs through the dike. Clay sloughs away in a slow collapse, and the first paddy begins to fill in earnest. You plant a stake anyway, driving it down with the flat of your palm. 
    
    "Flooding this won't bring him back," you say. Netta's eyes flick to the spreading water, to the rice bowing under it. For a long moment she says nothing. Then, almost to herself: "I wanted him to see what it costs." 
    
    "And what if he's willing to pay that to be free?"
    
    Netta inhales, sharp and shaky. She steps forward and sinks her hands back into the breach beside yours. "Then I suppose I'd be a fool to flood my own farm."

    The two of you work together, mending the breach. It is filthy, exhausting work, but the dike holds.

    "Your boy will learn nothing from this," you say. "Only that he was smart to leave."

    You meant it as cold assessment, a judgment of the futility in letting the dike collapse. But the words came wrong, edged with something cruel you had not intended. They settle in the humid air between you like stones dropped into still water.

    The woman goes rigid. Her hands stop their work, mud dripping from her fingers. She turns her head, and the look she fixes upon you carries no anger, only a frost so deep it seems to draw warmth from your bones. Then she rises from the breach, water streaming from her legs, and walks away without a word. Her footsteps squelch in the saturated earth. She does not look back.

    The dike gives.

    Water springs through the gap with sudden violence, no longer seeping but burbling forth in a muddy torrent. The breach widens as you watch, clay and packed earth tumbling into the flood. The first paddy field darkens as water spills across its surface, swallowing the neat rows of green rice. Even if you wished to stem it now, the work requires two pairs of hands, stakes driven while another packs the clay, reeds bundled and braced. You cannot hold it alone.

    You turn back to the raised path. Behind you, the water rushes on, claiming what it will.

    REVIEW: You seize a double handful of the sodden clay and wrench it free. The dike groans, a deep sound felt more than heard, as the gap widens. You hurl the mass into the flooding paddy. It strikes the water with a thick slap. Again you tear at the packed earth, fingers sinking deep into the yielding wall. Another chunk comes loose. You laugh as you cast it aside, and the sound carries across the fields like the cry of some carrion bird. Water surges through in a brown torrent that foams and churns, spreading between the rice stalks in dark fingers.

    The woman makes a small sound, wordless and raw. She staggers back from the failing wall, water sluicing past her knees, and her gaze fixes on the spreading flood. Something breaks in her expression, some final acceptance cracking like old pottery. Her hand drops to the earth and closes around a stone the size of a man's fist. She lifts it, trembling, and lurches toward you with the clumsy desperation of one who has never raised a hand in violence. The stone arcs through the air. You move. Your weapon finds her before she can complete the swing. She falls without ceremony into the muddy water, and the stone tumbles from her fingers.

    The dike continues its collapse behind you, water roaring through the widening breach. The paddy fields drink deep, rice stalks vanishing beneath the flood. Her son will return to find the house beneath dark water, the dike in ruins, and his mother cold among the drowned earth. Perhaps he will understand then what it means to abandon what must be tended. You turn from the wreckage and walk back along the raised path, leaving the water to claim what remains.

    You step down into the water beside her. The woman shifts to give you room, assuming help. You reach for the packed clay at the dike's base, where the structure is oldest, and dig your fingers in. The mud comes away easily once you know where to pry. You work a stone loose, then another, opening a channel beneath her fresh repairs. The water finds it immediately, eager, widening the gap from below.

    She sees what you've done. For a moment she only stares, hands still full of useless mud. Then she drops it and lunges. She's strong from years of this work and her fists find your chest, your jaw, blows without technique but full of weight. You go down into the water and she's on top of you, pressing your face into the silt, and you taste the fen, thick and old and furious. The dike gives with a sound like tearing cloth. The flood hits you both, a wall of brown water that sweeps her off and carries you ten feet before you find bottom.
  
    When you surface, coughing, she's already wading toward what remains of her home. The paddies are gone, merged into a single sheet of water reflecting white sky. You pull yourself onto the path and lie there, ribs aching, face throbbing, clothes heavy with silt
