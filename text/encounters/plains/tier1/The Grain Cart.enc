The Grain Cart

The cart sits alone at the crossroads, tilted on one broken axle. Sacks of grain are piled high beneath canvas, the lashings still tight, the whole load intact and untouched. No driver. No mule. Just the cart and the flies and the afternoon heat pressing down on the wheat fields.

You see the problem before you reach it. The axle didn't break from weight or rot. Someone pried the wheel off and left it ten paces down the road, half-hidden in the ditch. The cart's been abandoned deliberately, set here like bait. Or a message.

Movement catches your eye near the cart. A young man, nearly a boy, is struggling to pull a full sack from the wagon. He freezes under your gaze, pauses a long moment to think, then shouts "take one for yourself or walk on, stranger. It's been a hard year and this is the first bit of luck my family's had."

The smell of overripe wheat rolls across the fields. Cicadas drone in the heat.

choices:

* Take the grain = Perhaps it's your lucky day as well
  Your hands work quickly, lifting a sack onto your shoulder. The weight unbalances you, but you'll manage to the next settlement.

  You turn to find the cart's owner, two guards at his side. He sees the bag immediately. His eyes find your ring, and his face goes cold with calculation. "I had expected to travel three day with that grain, but here we have a buyer with ready coin. Just one sack then? Let me check my ledger."

  You curse your ill luck, but pay. The guards watch the coin change hands, bored witnesses to a transaction they've seen a dozen times. The merchant smiles, all teeth, and climbs back onto his repaired cart. The boy and his siblings are gone, vanished into the wheat. Your pack is lighter by coin and heavier by grain.

* Persuade the man to leave = Something feels amiss here

    You've seen this trap in three towns before. The owner and his men are hiding nearby, keen to extort silver from anyone foolish enough to steal from the cart. The boy's eyes widen as you explain the game, then he drops the sack and melts into the wheat without a word. Sure enough, as you continue down the road, you catch the glint of steel behind the stone wall where the merchant and his hired muscle wait for easier marks.

    You clear your throat and set about the tale of Old Man Yaniv and the grimlet—carefully, properly, with the necessary scaffolding. The grimlet, you explain, is not merely a creature of shadow and riddles but a cautionary mechanism in furred form, and its threefold bargains must be understood in sequence if one is to appreciate their symmetry. There are digressions, brief but essential, on the curing of jorgo root, on the contractual ambiguity of sunset, on the moral hazard of speaking imprecisely to entities who delight in precision. Somewhere during your clarification of root preparation methods, the boy’s attention begins to drift, and you, ever attentive to pedagogy, pivot smoothly to the more illustrative case of Yaniv and the Magic Fish.

    This second account you deliver with renewed vigor, outlining each wish and its unintended corollary, tracing the arc of folly with a steady finger as though diagramming it in the air. You conclude with a small, satisfied flourish, certain the lesson has landed squarely. When you turn to gauge the effect, however, there is only the cart, the mule, and the long shadows stretching across the road. The boy, presumably fortified with wisdom, has seen fit to depart before the final summary.

* Give this ruffian a thrashing = You'll not let theft go unpunished

    The boy takes one look at your stance and drops the sack, grain spilling across the dirt as he scrambles backward. He turns and runs into the wheat, the stalks swallowing him whole, his panicked breathing fading into the cicada drone. You continue down the road, leaving the tilted cart and its intact cargo to bake in the afternoon sun.

    REVIEW: You stride toward the youth with purpose. He does not cower. Instead, his shoulders tense, his feet shift to balance, and you glimpse in his stance some trace of training, or at least of many fights survived.

    He moves before you close the distance. The sack of grain, still gripped in both hands, rises and swings toward you with surprising force. It catches you across the chest and shoulder, a dull, heavy impact that staggers you backward. The weight of it, the suddenness, sends you sprawling into the dirt.

    Before you can rise, he is on you. He straddles your torso, pinning you against the ground with his knees, and his fists descend in rapid succession. The blows land across your jaw, your cheekbone, your brow. You taste copper. Your vision flashes white with each strike. He breathes hard through his teeth, his face taut with desperation, and you feel the weight of his intention: he means to end you here, to beat you senseless or worse.

    Then, abruptly, he stops. He springs off you and bolts, sprinting down the road toward the wheat fields. You roll to your side, gasping, the dust thick in your throat.

    Hoofbeats and the creak of leather reach your ears. You push yourself to your knees, blinking blood from one eye, and see three figures approaching: a broad man in merchant's garb astride a mule, flanked by two guards with cudgels in hand. The merchant reins in near the cart, his gaze sweeping the scene. He sees you, bloodied and still half-prone in the dirt, and his expression hardens.

    "Looks like the thieves turned on each other," he says, voice flat and certain. "One of them is still here."

    The guards move to either side of you. You raise a hand, wipe at your mouth, and speak slowly, forcing steadiness into your voice. You tell him you came upon the boy stealing from his cart. You tell him you meant to protect his grain, to stop the theft before it worsened.

    The merchant's eyes narrow. He glances at the cart, at the sacks still piled beneath their canvas, the lashings intact. He looks back to you, doubt plain in his face.

    "Nothing's been taken," he says after a long pause. "So there's no claim for a crime."

    One of the guards prods you with the end of his cudgel, a silent command to rise. You do, slowly, your ribs aching where the boy's knees pressed down. The merchant watches you stand, his jaw tight, his hand resting on the pommel of a short knife at his belt.

    "You'll move along now," he says. "And keep to your own road."

    You nod once, gather what dignity remains, and turn away from the cart. As you walk, you feel the merchant's gaze fixed on your back, heavy and mistrustful, until the crossroads and the broken cart are far behind you.
