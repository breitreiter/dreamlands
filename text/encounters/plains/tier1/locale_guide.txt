# The Grasslands

In the grasslands and scrub surrounding the Aldgate, farmers eke out a living supplying food to the city. They are a friendly enough sort, and focused on the daily realities of village life.

In the distance is the shining port city of Aldgate, home to Governer Ferdinand and the nobility and merchants. The farmers have mixed feelings, with some being feircely loyal to the city while others feel disdain toward the greedy and soft city folk.

It's nearing harvest time and the wheat fields are tall and roll with the wind.

## Encounters

There are no monsters or bandits in this locale.

Encounters should be bucolic, relatively low-stakes, and possibly somewhat whimsical. When oracle fragments suggest high stakes, interpret them at a scale appropriate to village life—personal consequences, social embarrassment, minor misfortune.

## Scene Palette

Characters: sunburnt farmers, off-duty guards with nowhere to be, grain merchants with ledgers, children chasing each other, traveling performers between gigs, bakers making deliveries, old-timers who remember when, porters hauling goods from the docks, a shepherd with too few sheep, someone's grandmother

Objects: baskets of bread rings, sacks of grain, clay jugs, a hand cart with a bad wheel, faded festival ribbons, a worn almanac, a lucky charm on a leather cord, a half-finished fence, an overloaded mule, a letter someone dropped

Sensory: wheat rolling like waves, chaff dust in afternoon light, smell of fresh bread and mule, flies circling lazily, distant harbor bells, cicadas in the scrub, someone practicing fiddle poorly, the creak of cart wheels, long shadows near dusk

Activities: haggling without urgency, napping in shade, hauling goods toward market, gossiping at the well, mending what's broken, arguing about weather or omens, shooing chickens, waiting for someone who's late

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a farmer disputing his grain price, a drunken guard looking for trouble, a child stealing bread from a sleeping baker
