# The Old Battlefields

Past the farmlands, the grass grows tall and untended over ground that was fought and bled over. Old wars left their mark here—earthworks, collapsed fortifications, mass graves that the soil hasn't fully digested. Nobody farms this land. Nobody settles it. The reasons are partly practical—the soil is churned and salted in places, the roads were destroyed and never rebuilt—and partly superstitious, and the superstitious reasons aren't entirely wrong.

The grass hides things. Rusted weapons, broken armor, bones, the remnants of camps and siege works. Scavengers pick through it—hard, practical people with shovels and no sentiment. They know the battlefields by name, by era, by what's likely to turn up. A good find—a intact blade, a piece of plate that just needs rust knocked off—is worth the trip. A bad find is a sinkhole into a collapsed earthwork, or digging up something that someone buried on purpose.

It's open country with no cover and few settlements. Weather hits hard. The wind is constant. At night the dark is absolute and the sounds carry strangely.

## Encounters

The land itself is the primary hazard—unstable ground, hidden pits, old trenches that collapse underfoot. Wildlife is present but skittish, not aggressive. The real tension is other scavengers: not necessarily hostile, but wary, territorial about their claims, and not happy to see competition.

Encounters should feel exposed, windswept, and uneasy. The landscape is a memorial that nobody maintains. Things surface that shouldn't. The past is close to the ground here.

## Scene Palette

Characters: a scavenger with a cart full of rusted iron and one good piece she's not showing anyone, a pair of diggers arguing about whose claim extends where, a former soldier visiting a battlefield he fought on and saying nothing, a merchant's hired picker working a grid pattern with professional detachment, a deserter living in a collapsed bunker who startles when found, a bone-collector working for a distant church, a scavenger sharpening a sword he just pulled from the dirt and testing its balance

Objects: a rusted breastplate with a hole in it, a mass of corroded weapons fused together by time, a rotting standard half-buried in mud, a scavenger's sieve for sifting soil, a bone that might be animal, a dented helmet being used as a cooking pot, a broken siege engine consumed by ivy, a leather satchel preserved in clay with its contents intact, a cairn that someone built recently over a very old grave, a sword that's in better condition than it should be

Sensory: wind through tall grass that sounds like whispering, the clang of a shovel hitting metal, soil that changes color in patches—darker where the blood soaked deepest, the smell of turned earth and old iron, grass tall enough to hide a crouching person, crows that gather and watch with patience, the feeling of walking on uneven ground that was once a trench, silence that magnifies small sounds, a sudden depression in the ground where something collapsed beneath, dusk light turning the grass the color of dried blood

Activities: digging carefully around a find, cataloguing salvage by quality, scanning the grass for surface signs of buried goods, dragging a cart through terrain with no road, setting up camp in the open with nothing to put your back against, cleaning rust from metal with sand and oil, testing whether a piece of armor still holds together, watching the horizon for other scavengers, stepping carefully around ground that feels hollow, building a fire from scrub brush that smokes too much

Tone reference (do not reuse these scenarios): a scavenger warns the player away from a particular mound, saying the last person who dug there didn't come back right, a digger shows off a pristine short sword and can't explain why it has no rust, a sudden collapse reveals a buried chamber that exhales stale air
