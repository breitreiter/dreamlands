Who Are You?

*The Harrower's* hold stinks of bilge and bodies, but at least it's dry. You've claimed a corner between cargo nets and a stack of water casks, far enough from the lanterns that no one takes much interest in you. Above, you hear the crew working the rigging, voices sharp with the urgency of landfall. 

Aldgate. The name tastes like opportunity and threat in equal measure. Fortunes to those willing to take them; death to those who underestimate the land.

You turn the seal ring over in your fingers, feeling the weight of gold against your palm. A signet ring, worn smooth from years of use. It has stamped contracts, treaties, death sentences. It is a ring that opens doors for the bearer, loosens tongues, carries the grim authority of the Trade Guild.

The ring catches the dim light as you slide it back onto your finger. The weight still feels new and unfamiliar.

How did you come by this ring?

choices:

* Murder = I took it by force
  REVIEW: The fat bastard bled more than you'd expected. You still feel the spray of it when you close your eyes, still see his hand twitching in that alley muck. The Guild will gut you for this theft if they catch you, but their reach doesn't extend to Aldgate's hungry shores. You've heard it is a land of blood and gold and shadow, and you were born for all three.

* Birthright = My mother once wore this, but it is now mine
  This was your mother's ring, a prize she fought for with ink and iron. She wore it like a blade, and men twice her size bent when its seal pressed wax. You remember the smell of hot resin and sea-salt in her hair, the way she would turn the signet once before a bargain, as if testing the world's grain for weakness. She said the ring would secure the family's future, and you mean to see that through.

* Gambling = I won it in a game
  You still remember the trader's face when you called his bluff; the way his confidence shattered as you laid down your cards. The whole den had gone silent, unsure of what this meant. The man had thought a Guild signet would cow a room of dockside rabble, but you've always had the devil's luck. Now his ruin buys your passage to Aldgate, where your luck will surely unlock even greater fortunes.

* A Gift = It was given to me
  The girl was nearly starved and half-mad when you found her, crouched beneath the roots of a storm-felled cedar. Her father's finest hunters gave up the search after the first week, muttering of spirits and spoor that walked in circles. You did not. You followed the broken language of the forest, the snapped twigs, the hush of disturbed birds, the faint drag-marks, and you found her. Later, in a hall heavy with smoke and gratitude, her father presented you with his ring. As folks tell the story, he is the noble and selfless father, and you are a nameless hunter. You've come here to make your own story, where your name will be remembered.

* A Commission = The Guild sent me
  The ring is yours. Not stolen, not inherited, not won, earned. Twelve years in the Guild's cartography corps, charting coastlines and trade routes from the Pale Reach to the Saffron Delta. You've bled for every league of parchment, fought off things in uncharted places that don't appear on any map because you decided they shouldn't. When the Guild needed someone to survey a new island they chose you. The commission came with the signet, the authority to requisition supplies and act in the Guild's name. You intend to draw the definitive map of this land. If you happen to turn a profit along the way, well. You are Guild, after all.
