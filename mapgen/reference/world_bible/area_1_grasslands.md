# Aldgate

Aldgate is primarily a trade stopover along several profitable trade routes. It was established as a beachhead for a
planned colony on the island. While the island colony has largely failed, Aldgate remains a bulwark for splendor and
luxury. The city is ruled by Governer Ferdinand, who is primarily concerned with managing the port and intrigue
among the local nobility.

Nearly anything can be had in Aldgate, for a price.

Ferdinand maintains a city guard, but his soldiers do not venture very far. They protect the nearby farmers, but 
largely ignore the outlands.

The city is built of polished white stone, sturdy timber, and thatch. Ferdinand's palace is in High City, alongside
fancy shops, government buildings, and guild houses.

The docks are in Low City, where the laws are a bit looser. Tall ships sail in and out, carrying their splendid
cargo to distant lands.

# The Grasslands

In the grasslands and scrub surrounding the city, farmers eke out a living supplying food to Aldgate. They are a
friendly enough sort, and focused on the daily realities of village life.

It's nearing harvest time and the wheat fields are tall and roll with the wind.

# Encounters

There are no hidden barrows, lost tombs, monsters, or bandits in this locale.

Encounters should be bucolic, relatively low-stakes, and possibly somewhat whimsical. 

Examples:
- a farmer thinks he is getting a poor deal on his grain and asks the PC to act as an arbiter
- a drunken guard bumps into the PC and wants to start a brawl
- there's a sleeping baker on the side of the road carrying a basket of bread rings. a child is stealing one. 
- a shady figure offers to sell the pc a "magic book," but is evasive on the contents. the book actually is magic! it reveals the location of a distant wizard's tower, long abandoned
- a threadbare troupe of acrobats has set up a stage and invites the PC to stop for a performance
