we create a series of encounter templates.

something like
- danger.monster
- danger.obstacle
- help_request.person
- help_offer.reputation

each is defined as:
- name
- fairly prescriptive (but abstract) scene structure
- abstract list of player selections (FIGHT, HIDE, SNEAK, CONTEMPLATE, POWER_THROUGH, etc). These each map to in-game task resolution mechanics (when appropriate)

we feed the model:
- region dictionary (1-5 x biome)
- template
- guidance for writing the scene text
- mandate to select either 2 or 3 abstract player selections

final passes for each epilogue

TEMPLATE: Mysterious Stranger at Crossroads
ELIGIBLE: TALK, BRIBE, INTIMIDATE, SNEAK, INVESTIGATE, IGNORE

esolved when the epilogue ends.
