## The Chapterhouse

The Chapterhouse replaces the inn in Aldgate. There is only one.

The Chapterhouse costs no gold.

Using the Chapterhouse clears all conditions. The Chapterhouse does not disqualify you for any condition.

The Chapterhouse otherwise function the same as an inn, except you are only quoted time cost.

### Description

The lobby silently attests the Merchant Guild's might. Marble floors veined with gold, walls hung with maps of trade routes that span three continents, and above it all a vaulted dome painted with a rising sun. The air smells of woodsmoke and roasting meat. The polished oak desk at the center of the lobby is manned by a wizened guild clerk who looks up from his ledger. "Welcome colleague. How long will you be staying with us?"

## Inns

Inns are largely a QoL feature.

They exist in all settlements.

They cannot be used if:
- You have any conditions which require medicine/bandages to treat AND
- You do not have enough medicine/bandages on-hand to treat all current conditions

This is because serious conditions damage health daily. The inn recovers 1 health daily. Your stay would be infinite (or you would die in the inn).

The inn has two modes:
- Spend one night
- Spend enough nights to heal to full

The inn has two pricing structures:
- One night - free
- Multiple nights - each night at an inn costs the same as buying 3 food

Using the inn:
- Checks if you have disqualifying conditions
- If you do, warns you to seek medicine immediately
- Checks the lower of your Health or Spirits
- Calculates the number of nights required to restore you fully (1 health + 1 spirits per day)
- Presents you with a quote of time + money for full recovery
- Presents you with an alternate option to only stay one night

Depending on your choice:
- If you approve the full recovery quote: in a single step, recovers you fully and advances time
- If you stay only one night: perform normal end-of-day
