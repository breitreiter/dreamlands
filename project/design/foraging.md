foraging is an action players may take when on any non-settlement tile.

players may only forage when they could move (thus not in encounters or while resolving end-of-day)

like movement, foraging advances time one step. this may mean that foraging immediately leads to end-of-day.

1. check haversack. if no space left: Your haversack is full. You'll need to clear space before you can forage.
2. the PC checks bushcraft vs DC12. rewards are selected from biome-appropriate items
- hit - 1 food
- +5 - 2 food
- +10 - 3 food + medicine
3. add items to haversack, allowing overflow if necessary
