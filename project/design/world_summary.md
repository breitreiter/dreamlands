## Plains

**Tier 1 — Heartland.** Warm wind, golden fields, church bells, ledgers and ink. The plains heartland is a breadbasket of grain, wool, and livestock organized into a dense merchant culture built on contracts, tithes, and guild law. Aldgate sits here as the empire's financial and administrative hub. Trade is the engine; conflicts are small-scale but real — grain weights, inheritance disputes, imperial policy opinions. Nobody doubts the system; they argue about their position in it. They keep receipts.

**Tier 2 — Wildlands.** The failed campaign zone. No towns — only half-occupied forts, embarrassed military patrols still technically guarding nothing, and scavenger bands who operate like guilds with territory claims. The empire built roads, depots, and signal towers out here, then retreated. What remains is skeletonized infrastructure, cratered walls, and stone vitrified in ways no siege engine could explain. Everyone is defensive. Everyone believes the land still belongs to someone. The economy runs on salvage and army surplus moving back toward the heartland.

**Tier 3 — The Abandoned City.** A mirror of Aldgate, intact and empty. Doors closed. Granaries vacant. Market stalls undisturbed. The machines that shattered an imperial army are still running — not out of malice, but because no one turned them off. The grid activates on density thresholds and weapon signatures. The golems announce their part numbers in crisp utilitarian script. They do not chase beyond parameters. They enforce. The empire ran the numbers and decided deactivation wasn't worth the cost. The horror is that nothing here is angry at you.

## Mountain

**Tier 1 — Mining Folk.** Narrow valley hollows, timber houses clinging to slopes, rope-and-pulley lifts, smokehouses leaning at angles. These are salt-of-the-earth Appalachian-coded mining communities: trappers, charcoal burners, ridge families in debt to company scrip. People measure each other by whether you show up when a roof collapses. Loyalty is relational and kinship-based; the system is rigged in favor of mine owners comfortable in Aldgate, and everyone knows it. Trade exists but is colored by whose side you're on.

**Tier 2 — Scholars.** Remote institutions on the upper slopes — monasteries, academies, observatories built into the mountainside with thick walls and reading-light windows. Swiss-German austere. The Lesehalle. The Graue Bibliothek. The Druckwerk. Scholars see the whole system clearly and care deeply about abstract injustice while remaining stoically detached from individual suffering. They want to fix the mines but will spend miners' lives cheaply in service of a more just structure. The alliance collapses every time a crisis forces the question: "they hurt my friend" versus "yes, but the system."

**Tier 3 — The Stift.** A court of cosmic authority where grievances that mortal institutions cannot resolve are brought for supernaturally binding judgment. The original Stift is granite — cavernous halls, stone benches, ceilings too high, light that feels rationed. It sounds like the ultimate recourse. The reality is an elegant, comfortable, interminable bureaucracy. Trial dates shift. Forms multiply. Petitioners become long-term residents. Adversaries become dinner companions. The Wandelgang puts you on the same path as the person you came to prosecute, and over time you stop looking at the Wegtafel. The frozen injustice is a betrayal. The resolved injustice is a catastrophe.

## Forest

**Tier 1 — Forest Folk.** Working wood — managed, negotiated, and imperfectly owned. Woodcutters, charcoal burners, and trappers who mark trees obsessively, say little about the deep wood, and do not romanticize the forest. Short blunt settlement names: Thornrun, Harth Glen, Brask. Buildings built to disappear into the undergrowth. Trade is active and merchants are welcome; news and practical imports are valued. Forest folk warn travelers about the deep-wood exiles, typically calling them bandits or worse.

**Tier 2 — Deep Wood Exiles.** Refuge for those who could not remain: clan sons who refused blood-feuds, mountain deserters, debtors, Lattice defectors who asked the wrong question. Loose camps in hidden clearings with false trails leading nowhere. No law — only proximity and mutual suspicion. Everyone is hiding from something and assumes you are too. The economy is specialist and high-value: medicinal extracts, poisons, rare fungi, figured wood, luck charms. They trade, they lie, and they keep watch.

**Tier 3 — The Hunter.** One person. Disciplined, patient, and competent — a mirror of the player. The forest is dense with snares, deadfalls, and friction traps. Routes subtly loop. Cairns and blazes are reversed to lure travelers off safe ground. Their dwelling is austere and orderly: tools cleaned, topographic sketches annotated, tokens from previous hunts tagged and dated in calm handwriting. The horror is not death but the realization that there was never an outside. You entered a narrative and mistook friction for chance.

## Scrub

**Tier 1 — Plateau Clans.** The borderlands: wind-cut plateaus, trading frontier, clan caravans. Honor-based kinship with strong local autonomy — hospitality is binding but political. Announce yourself properly, accept offered food, acknowledge the host's authority. The few Kesharat personnel who appear here are fish out of water, subjected to merciless teasing by the locals. Rare spices, aromatics, preserved foods, and handcrafted metalwork flow outward. Clan folk compete for caravan traffic and prize news as much as goods.

**Tier 2 — Kesharat Administration.** The comedy of tier 1 drops away. Kesharat settlements appear along the rail lines; armed patrols make a deliberate show of force. Infrastructure expands — rail, depots, signal towers — into clan-held land, justified as alignment with the Lattice. Water rights are a flashpoint. Clan identity conflicts with administrative procedure; oral law collides with written codes. Civil priests explain the Lattice with evangelical patience and somehow make less sense the longer they talk. The rail is always advancing.

**Tier 3 — The Lattice.** The pretense collapses. The air feels wrong — too still, or vibrating at a frequency just below hearing. There is a color with no name that cannot be properly perceived, that illuminates nearby objects in ways that hurt to look at. Workers exposed to it lose individuality and become human machines: alive, functional, and utterly broken. Kesharat leadership is fully compromised; they are no longer making decisions in any human sense. Lower-ranking true believers insist this is correction and alignment. In tier 3, the Kesharat become a little sympathetic — they are victims too, even as they do the Lattice's work.

## Swamp

*No world bible exists. Content below is extrapolated from ecology and trade patterns.*

**Tier 1 — Wetland Towns.** Stilt settlements and high-ground hamlets connected by flat-bottomed boats poled through slow channels. Reed-cutters, peat harvesters, and bog fishers who read the water the way plains folk read weather. The swamp provides if you know how to ask it. Outsiders are regarded with mild amusement — getting hopelessly lost is the most predictable thing they do. Raw goods flow outward: resin, leeches, peat fuel, river reeds. Locals hire out as guides and decline to explain their routes.

**Tier 2 — Specialists and River Traders.** Deeper water, darker channels. The settlements thin and the people become specialists in things polite society needs but doesn't ask about: embalming chemistry, dye extraction, venom harvesting, bog-iron dredging. River traders know routes no map records. Crocodilian hunters and apothecary gatherers operate in overlapping and occasionally violent territory. The economy is murky in both senses — transactions happen, provenance is not discussed, and certain questions are understood to not be worth asking.

**Tier 3 — The Deep Swamp.** No solid ground. Routes that seemed navigable close behind you. Sound carries wrong — too far, or swallowed entirely. Whatever lives in the true interior has not been reliably described, because those who go deep enough do not come back with coherent accounts. The horror is dissolution rather than destruction: not being killed but being absorbed. The swamp does not attack. It simply becomes everything, and eventually you become part of it.
