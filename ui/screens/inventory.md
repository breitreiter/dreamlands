# inventory

## pack
- pack size, used/empty
- list of items, grouped by type
- for weapons/armor/boots, equipped status + equip/unequip button
- discard button

## scrip
- size, used/empty
- list of items, grouped by type. 
- discard button

packs only have an inventory rating, so you always want the largest available. no affordance for swapping or unequipping packs. you pick up bigger pack, it goes straight to equipped. old pack falls off into new pack's inventory. (safe because larger)

junk acquired during encounters can overflow pack size.

scrip size is fixed but generous.

small consumables (food, medicine) go in the scrip.
large bulky items (armor, tools, trade goods) go in pack

all PCs start with a junk weapon (walking stick), junk armor (travelling clothes), and junk boots (worn turnshoes)
