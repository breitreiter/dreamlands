# World exploration

## variances
- if the player navigates to a new tile and an encounter is randomly triggered, show the encounter screen instead of (or atop) this screen. Wait until the encounter is resolved.
- if the player navigates to a settlement tile, instead show the settlement view

## map
- multiple zoom levels (tactical/strategic)
- scale to screen size
- in cli mode, this may just be a list of adjacent tiles (biome and explored status) plus a command to open a full-screen map

## status
- time of day
- player health, spirits
- terse summary of conditions
- gold, general characterization of inventory (pack light, pack full, etc)

## tile summary
- region name + biome
- terse flavor text
- if an unfinished dungeon is here, show an option to enter
- if a finished dungeon is here, show a message to that effect

## navigation
- available cardinal directions
