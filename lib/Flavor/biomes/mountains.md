MOUNTAIN — BIOME BIBLE
Theme / Philosophy: The mountain is an examination of justice — specifically, the relationship between suffering and the institutions built to address it. Each tier of elevation represents a greater distance between the person who suffers and the person who acts on their behalf. The higher you climb, the more you can see, and the less any single person's pain weighs against the system's need to perpetuate itself. Altitude is abstraction. The air gets thinner and so does the connection to the grievance that started the climb.
Defining Contradiction: Everyone on this mountain is motivated by justice, and each tier demonstrates a different way that justice fails — not through malice, but through distance. The miners' justice is immediate, relational, and righteous, but it can't see the system. The scholars' justice is principled and structural, but it spends individual lives cheaply in service of abstractions. The peak's justice is procedurally complete and functionally inert — a system so sophisticated it has replaced the thing it was built to do. The mountain's final horror is the possibility that some injustices are better left unresolved, because the resolution costs more than the crime. This is an idea that would make the miners sick, that the scholars suspect but never say plainly, and that the peak has internalized so completely its inhabitants no longer recognize it as betrayal.

Tier 1 — The Lowlands and Approaches (Appalachian-coded mining communities)
Salt-of-the-earth working people — trappers, miners, charcoal burners. Their moral world is relational: loyalty, kinship, community. They understand that the system is rigged in favor of the mine owners in their comfortable mansions in Aldgate, and they resent it in the abstract, but that resentment is cold compared to the heat of watching someone they love get hurt, get sick, or lose their home. Their anger is proportional to proximity. Justice, to them, is a guy named Bill getting what he's owed. Their strength is that they'll never abandon a neighbor. Their vulnerability is that this loyalty makes them exploitable — the system can hurt them one at a time and they'll never organize a structural response, only a series of personal ones.

Tier 2 — The Upper Slopes (The Scholars)
A strange inverse of the miners. They occupy remote institutions — monasteries, academies, observatories — and they see the whole system clearly. They get genuinely upset about abstract injustice: structural inequality, corrupt institutions, the mechanisms by which wealth is extracted from labor. But they view individual suffering with a kind of stoic detachment. Some of them sincerely want to help the miners. The problem is that their attachment to systemic thinking means they're willing to spend miners' lives cheaply if the result is a more just system. They think the miners are heartbreakingly short-sighted. The miners think the scholars are heartlessly detached. They are both correct. They're angry at the same things and they think they agree, until something happens and it's time to point fingers — and then the alliance collapses because one side says "they hurt my friend" and the other says "yes, but the system." Source: the real dynamics of political organizing.

Tier 3 — The Peak (The Supernatural Court)
A court of cosmic authority where grievances that mortal institutions cannot resolve are brought for supernaturally binding judgment. It sounds like the ultimate recourse — the place where justice finally, definitively happens. The reality is an elegant, comfortable, interminable bureaucracy. Trial dates shift. Forms multiply. There is always progress, but it moves in circles. While petitioners wait, they begin to socialize with their adversaries. Both sides are educated, charismatic, pragmatic. They take the long view. The incessant delays become a part-time job — a few hours of paperwork, a letter home about progress being made, then dinner with the people you came to prosecute. The system is not broken. It works exactly well enough to keep everyone engaged, comfortable, and present. The endless delays are the mechanism by which adversaries are converted into peers. The bureaucracy is also a ceasefire. The comfortable dinners are also diplomacy. The frozen conflict is unjust, but it is stable.

The PC's Role
The PC functions as a Dying Earth protagonist — a catalyst, not a hero. They wander into stable-but-untenable situations and introduce instability. They are the hammer that strikes the Prince Rupert's Drop: a glass bead under enormous internal tension, perfectly stable as long as the surface remains intact. The PC chips the tail — asks the wrong question, files the right form, actually reads a document nobody was supposed to read — and the whole thing detonates. The comfortable stasis collapses. Delegates who had become friends are suddenly adversaries again. Petitioners who wrote cheerful letters home must face years of accomplished nothing. Judges must actually rule, and someone must lose.

The Final Scene
The beautiful institutional halls collapse into warring factions. Blood, fire, screaming. The PC stands in the wreckage having done the objectively righteous thing — they exposed the hypocrisy, shattered the comfortable fraud, forced the unresolved grievance into the open. And the result is worse than the stasis. The frozen injustice was a betrayal of the miners. The resolved injustice is a catastrophe. The PC is left with: "I guess I showed them. I guess this is what fixed looks like."
Mirror Structure with Forest: In the forest, the final encounter is a mirror — the hunter's house shows the PC their own reflection and says "you're more like this monster than you think." On the mountain, the final encounter is also a mirror, but inverted. The burning hall shows the PC their own handiwork and says "you're more like these hypocrites than you think, because you also believed justice would be clean."

# Mining Folk

## Cultural Through-Line

**Kinship + Suspicion of Authority + Moral Pragmatism**

They are not grim stoics. They are:

* deeply loyal to extended family
* suspicious of outsiders (especially well-dressed ones)
* quick to laugh, quicker to test you
* quietly resentful of distant corporate powers

They measure a person by:

* Do you show up when someone’s roof collapses?
* Do you share when the mine closes?
* Do you sing at a wake?

They do not trust law. They trust memory.

Their morality is not abstract — it is situational and relational.

## Architectural Language

Forget stone fortresses.

Think:

* Narrow timber houses clinging to slopes
* Porches that overlook valleys
* Smokehouses and tool sheds leaning at angles
* Rope-and-pulley lifts for hauling goods up steep inclines
* Company-owned brick structures down in the mining towns (stark contrast)

Wood dominates. Things creak. Everything has been repaired three times.

Settlements are vertical, not horizontal. Paths zig-zag.

---

## Linguistic Shape

We avoid dwarven harshness. No -gund, -thar, -drin.

Instead: soft but clipped. Musical but weathered.

### Phonetic Palette

* Consonants: h, w, r, d, t, k
* Soft g and b
* Diphthongs: ai, ow, ee
* Dropped endings in casual speech

Less “iron anvil,” more “ridge wind.”

### Structural Patterns

* Names derived from terrain features
* Many -hollow, -ridge, -run, -gap, -branch equivalents
* Multi-word settlement names are common
* Personal names become place names quickly

### Settlement Structure Rules

* (Family Name)’s (Landform)
* (Descriptor) + (Hollow/Run/Ridge)
* 2–3 syllables, rhythm matters more than weight

### Examples

* Briar Run
* Kestrel Hollow
* Harrow Gap
* Dane’s Ridge
* Lowwater Branch
* Ashfall
* Rook’s Landing
* High Ember
* Willowcrest

Short, human, lived-in.

## Social Texture

### Speech Style

* Indirect confrontation
* Proverbs instead of argument
* Humor that hides pain
* Outsiders are called “downlanders” or “valefolk”

### Religion / Belief

* Syncretic and personal
* Bible-equivalent exists, but so do ghost stories
* Old mine tunnels are said to “remember”

Superstition is practical, not mystical. You don’t whistle in the shafts. You leave bread at a cave mouth before blasting.

---

## Economic Reality

The tension is key:

* Independent ridge families
* Company towns in the valleys
* Debt paid in scrip
* Strikes simmering

This gives you:

* moral gray conflicts
* labor unrest quests
* family-vs-company story arcs

Without ever touching dwarven tropes.

# Scholars

Architecturally, this is the best part. Swiss-German institutional architecture is austere, functional, and quietly magnificent. Think the Abbey of Saint Gall — a thousand-year-old library with perfect order, every book catalogued, built on a mountainside. Timber and stone. Clean lines. No ornamentation for its own sake, but the precision is the beauty. Windows sized for reading light, not for showing off. Thick walls because the mountain demands it, but the thickness also means silence. These buildings say "we are serious about thinking and we do not need you to be impressed."

# Final Horror

## The Stift
Basically magic hague on a mountain.

The original Stift is granite. Massive. Old beyond reckoning. The halls where proceedings happen are cavernous, cold, lit by high narrow windows that make the light feel rationed. The ceilings are too high. The benches are stone. When you first arrive and walk into the central hall, you feel exactly what you're supposed to feel: this is serious, this is ancient, this is bigger than you. Your grievance matters because this place is willing to hear it. The architecture is doing the same work as a cathedral — making you small so the institution can be large.

But nobody can live in a cathedral.

So around the original granite core, a second Stift has grown. Timber-framed buildings leaning against the stone walls like barnacles. Dormitories that started as austere cells and have been gradually domesticated — a rug here, a writing desk there, personal effects accumulating because everyone's stay keeps getting extended. Some of the older dorms have been occupied so long they're basically apartments. You can tell how long someone's been at the Stift by how comfortable their room is.

The commercial area grew organically out of necessity. When people started staying for months instead of weeks, someone opened a tea house. Then a bakery. Then a stationer, because you always need more paper. Then a tailor, because your clothes wear out. There's a small market square that has no business existing at this altitude — everything is hauled up the mountain at great expense — but the delegates have money and the delays create demand. The tea houses are where the real socializing happens. They're warm, well-lit, intimate — the opposite of the granite halls. And that contrast is doing critical narrative work. The proceedings happen in a space designed to make you feel the weight of justice. The friendships happen in spaces designed to make you feel comfortable. You shuttle between the two and over time you spend more hours in the tea house than the hall.

The communal dining should exist but feel transitional — like it was the original design and it's being slowly replaced. New arrivals eat in the common hall because they don't know anyone yet. Long-timers eat at the tea houses, at private dinners, in each other's apartments. The common hall is where you'd eat if you still remembered this was supposed to be temporary. The tea house is where you eat once you've settled in. So the PC arriving at the common hall and finding it half-empty is itself a piece of environmental storytelling — where is everyone?

A few other details that might help:

The Schreibstube — the writing room. A shared workspace where petitioners draft their filings, appeals, and letters home. It should be genuinely well-stocked: good paper, good ink, reference materials, helpful clerks. The system wants you to engage with it. The tools for seeking justice are excellent. The act of filing is almost pleasurable. This is the room where righteous fury gets metabolized into procedure, one well-crafted document at a time.

The Wegtafel — a massive board or carved relief near the entrance showing the procedural steps to resolution. It's beautiful, detailed, and incomprehensible — not because it's poorly designed but because there are so many steps, so many branches, so many conditional paths. New arrivals study it with determination. Long-timers don't look at it anymore. Someone has probably hung their coat on it.

The Wandelgang — covered walking galleries, cloistered paths around courtyards. This is where adversaries first start talking to each other. You're both pacing, waiting for a hearing, and the architecture literally puts you on the same path. Walking together. The physical space converts opposition into companionship through sheer proximity and repetition. You can't pace a cloister with someone for three months without eventually saying hello.
