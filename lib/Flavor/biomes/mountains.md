# The Mountains (Reworked)

*High ridges, coal seams, company scrip, switchback roads, hard winters.*

## Core Ecological Driver

Isolation + extraction.

The mountains don’t produce abundance — they produce *resources for someone else*. Ore, coal, rare stone. Wealth flows downriver. What stays is dust and debt.

Travel is slow. Valleys become worlds. A family on the next ridge might as well be a foreign nation.

---

## Cultural Through-Line

**Kinship + Suspicion of Authority + Moral Pragmatism**

They are not grim stoics. They are:

* deeply loyal to extended family
* suspicious of outsiders (especially well-dressed ones)
* quick to laugh, quicker to test you
* quietly resentful of distant corporate powers

They measure a person by:

* Do you show up when someone’s roof collapses?
* Do you share when the mine closes?
* Do you sing at a wake?

They do not trust law. They trust memory.

Their morality is not abstract — it is situational and relational.

---

## Architectural Language

Forget stone fortresses.

Think:

* Narrow timber houses clinging to slopes
* Porches that overlook valleys
* Smokehouses and tool sheds leaning at angles
* Rope-and-pulley lifts for hauling goods up steep inclines
* Company-owned brick structures down in the mining towns (stark contrast)

Wood dominates. Things creak. Everything has been repaired three times.

Settlements are vertical, not horizontal. Paths zig-zag.

## Linguistic Shape

We avoid dwarven harshness. No -gund, -thar, -drin.

Instead: soft but clipped. Musical but weathered.

### Phonetic Palette

* Consonants: h, w, r, d, t, k
* Soft g and b
* Diphthongs: ai, ow, ee
* Dropped endings in casual speech

Less “iron anvil,” more “ridge wind.”

### Structural Patterns

* Names derived from terrain features
* Many -hollow, -ridge, -run, -gap, -branch equivalents
* Multi-word settlement names are common
* Personal names become place names quickly

### Settlement Structure Rules

* (Family Name)’s (Landform)
* (Descriptor) + (Hollow/Run/Ridge)
* 2–3 syllables, rhythm matters more than weight

### Examples

* Briar Run
* Kestrel Hollow
* Harrow Gap
* Dane’s Ridge
* Lowwater Branch
* Ashfall
* Rook’s Landing
* High Ember
* Willowcrest

Short, human, lived-in.

## Social Texture

### Speech Style

* Indirect confrontation
* Proverbs instead of argument
* Humor that hides pain
* Outsiders are called “downlanders” or “valefolk”

### Religion / Belief

* Syncretic and personal
* Bible-equivalent exists, but so do ghost stories
* Old mine tunnels are said to “remember”

Superstition is practical, not mystical. You don’t whistle in the shafts. You leave bread at a cave mouth before blasting.

---

## Economic Reality

The tension is key:

* Independent ridge families
* Company towns in the valleys
* Debt paid in scrip
* Strikes simmering

This gives you:

* moral gray conflicts
* labor unrest quests
* family-vs-company story arcs

Without ever touching dwarven tropes.

## What Makes Them Not Dwarves

* They live *on* the mountain, not under it
* They are wood-and-soil, not stone-and-iron
* Their strength is communal, not martial

# Bonus: Ridge Speech Rhythm

Mountain names tend to have:

* Stress on first syllable
* Clipped endings
* Easy yell-ability

Try saying them aloud across a canyon:
“AR-len!”
“DEL-ia!”
“BOONE!”

If it echoes well, it fits.
