Oh, this is exactly the right kind of problem. You don’t want “Fantasy France” and “Fantasy Japan.” You want internally coherent invented cultures that *feel* anthropologically grounded without mapping 1:1 to Earth.

Below is a framework for each biome:

* **Phonetic / naming logic** (sound palette + structural rules)
* **Architectural language**
* **Cultural / philosophical through-line**
* A few **example settlement names**

The goal is not “real world analog,” but ecological + economic determinism: geography → subsistence → social organization → worldview → sound-shape of language.

# 1. The Plains

*Rolling hills, grain farmers, proximity to Aldgate.*

### Core Ecological Driver

Predictable seasons. Surplus grain. Open visibility. Trade routes.

### Cultural Through-Line

**Stewardship + Continuity.**
They think in terms of *inheritance*, *lineage*, *soil memory*, and *what lasts*. The plains produce surplus, which produces contracts, which produces law.

They distrust novelty. Change is tolerated only if it can be written down.

They are polite, but they are not naive.

### Architectural Language

* Whitewashed stone farmhouses
* Timber beams darkened with oil
* Broad barns with deep eaves
* Wind-worn wooden granaries
* Low stone walls following field boundaries

Everything is rectangular. Measured. Surveyed.

### Linguistic Shape

**Phonetic Palette**

* Soft consonants: b, d, m, n, l, r, v
* Long vowels: a, o, ē
* Few harsh clusters
* Words feel “round” and stable

**Settlement Pattern**

* Suffixes meaning field, hill, ford, gate
* Two-part compounds
* Patronymic references

**Structural Rules**

* (Descriptor) + (Landform)
* (Family Name) + -mere / -vale / -ford
* Vowel-heavy, easy to say

**Examples**

* Valemere
* Brannon Vale
* Alderford
* Lorrenfield
* Dovenshire
* Marrow Hill
* Norvale Gate

# 2. The Swamp

*Rice farmers, fisherfolk, tidal rhythms, uneasy boundaries.*

### Core Ecological Driver

Water controls everything. Tides, rot, silt, hidden channels.

### Cultural Through-Line

**Adaptation + Negotiation.**
Nothing is permanent. You build on stilts. You move with the water. You bargain with what you cannot defeat.

They value flexibility over law. Oaths are fluid, but grudges are not.

Spirituality likely animistic — everything has a mood.

### Architectural Language

* Raised wooden walkways
* Houses on stilts
* Thatched roofs weighted with nets
* Clay shrines near waterlines
* Lanterns and reeds everywhere

Structures look provisional, even when decades old.

### Linguistic Shape

**Phonetic Palette**

* Nasals: ng, nh, m
* Liquids: l, r
* Open vowels: a, u, i
* Occasional glottal breaks or doubled vowels

**Settlement Pattern**

* Short names
* Repetition
* Liquid flow sound
* Many “marsh-channel” compound names

**Structural Rules**

* 1–2 syllables, vowel-rich
* Consonants often softened or doubled
* Names may reference water directly

**Examples**

* Naru
* Luma
* Heshan
* Mirella
* Uruhn
* Salla Bend
* Three-Reed Crossing
* Ka’ru Marsh

# 3. The Forest

*Working woods near civilization, not primeval myth forest.*

### Core Ecological Driver

Boundaries blur. Paths exist, but not clearly. Ownership is patchy. Resources are renewable but slow.

### Cultural Through-Line

**Custodianship + Reputation.**
You don’t own forest — you are tolerated by it. Communities are small and reputation-based. Outsiders are measured quietly.

Forest people think in terms of *balance* and *reciprocity*, not law.

They are practical mystics: mushrooms and timber, not druids and moon cults.

### Architectural Language

* Timber frames with bark left visible
* Moss-grown shingles
* Fences made from woven saplings
* Carved boundary markers
* Shrines to ancestors carved into trees

Buildings look like they were assembled from what was at hand — and they were.

### Linguistic Shape

**Phonetic Palette**

* Harder consonants: k, t, sk, br, gr
* Short vowels
* Consonant clusters
* Occasional harsh endings

**Settlement Pattern**

* Compact names
* Names tied to trees, tools, or animals
* Lots of k, r, t sounds

**Structural Rules**

* (Tool/Tree) + (Hollow/Cleft/Run)
* Harsh endings: -sk, -t, -rk
* Fewer vowels than plains

**Examples**

* Brask Hollow
* Ternsk
* Korrun
* Redbark Run
* Harth Glen
* Skelwood
* Thornreach

# 4. The Barrens

*Dry lands, trade routes, loosely Arabic map markers but we’ll abstract.*

### Core Ecological Driver

Scarcity. Water = power. Trade = survival.

### Cultural Through-Line

**Honor + Memory.**
In dry lands, betrayal kills. Hospitality becomes sacred. Contracts are oral and binding.

They value eloquence. Poetry is not ornament — it is social currency.

They are not “exotic.” They are intensely practical traders with strong kin networks.

### Architectural Language

* Wind-carved stone
* Courtyard compounds
* Flat roofs
* Shade arcades
* Geometric tilework (non-specific cultural borrowing)

Buildings cluster inward. Privacy matters.

### Linguistic Shape

**Phonetic Palette**

* Emphatic consonants: q, kh, z, s
* Repeated vowels: aa, ii
* Triconsonantal-feeling roots
* Rhythmic syllables

**Settlement Pattern**

* Three-syllable names common
* Consonant-vowel alternation
* Names often start with vowel or voiced consonant

**Structural Rules**

* (Root)-(vowel)-(suffix)
* -im, -ar, -esh, -un endings
* Internal rhythm matters

**Examples**

* Qazirun
* Salimaar
* Varesht
* Iqalan
* Zareem
* Kharun’s Rest
* Talasheen

# 5. The Mountains

*Miners, danger, corporate exploitation.*

### Core Ecological Driver

Dangerous labor. Isolation. Resource extraction. Hard winters.

### Cultural Through-Line

**Endurance + Solidarity.**
Mountains breed mutual dependence. If someone fails, everyone pays.

They distrust distant authorities (like mining companies). Their ethics revolve around fairness in labor and shared risk.

Humor is dry. Grudges last generations.

### Architectural Language

* Stone block buildings
* Heavy timber supports
* Iron fittings
* Deep-set windows
* Functional, not decorative

Everything looks like it was built to survive avalanche or riot.

### Linguistic Shape

**Phonetic Palette**

* Heavy consonants: d, g, th, r, k
* Closed vowels
* Final consonant stops
* Thick, grounded sound

**Settlement Pattern**

* Short, punchy names
* Named after ore or founder
* Harsh endings: -drin, -gar, -thar, -gund

**Structural Rules**

* 1–2 syllables
* Stress on first syllable
* Few flowing vowels

**Examples**

* Durngar
* Kethrin
* Brund
* Ironfell
* Galthar
* Redgund
* Thrain’s Cut
