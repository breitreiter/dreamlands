# 🌾 PLAINS — Philosophy & Progression

## Core Theme:

**Order is a tool. When it scales, it becomes indifferent.**

The plains are where humans try to make the world legible.

* Fields in rows.
* Roads straight.
* Taxes predictable.
* Borders surveyed.
* Armies disciplined.

The danger is not chaos.

The danger is systems that continue because they are efficient — not because they are humane.

# Tier 1 — Productive Order

### Philosophy:

Order is beneficial, mostly fair, occasionally frustrating.

This is agriculture and contract law.

People here believe in:

* Trade.
* Incremental improvement.
* Civic duty.
* Stability.

Conflicts are small-scale but real:

* Merchant leverage.
* Grain weights.
* Inheritance disputes.
* Disagreements about imperial policy.

No one doubts the system.
They just argue about their position in it.

---

### Tone:

Warm wind.
Golden fields.
Wooden fences.
Church bells.
Ledgers and ink.

---

### Settlement Naming Style (Aldgate-adjacent archaic British)

* **Bramfield**
* **Easthollow**
* **Merewick**
* **Harthcombe**
* **Dunlow Barrow**
* **Westfold Tithing**
* **Cresswell Vale**
* **Longmere**

---

### People Names (Vaguely Archaic British)

**Men**

* Osric Hale
* Thomlin Ward
* Bertram Gower
* Aldous Fenrick
* Edric Mallory
* Wymond Pike

**Women**

* Maud Harrow
* Elswyth Gower
* Joan Fenrick
* Catrin Hale
* Winifred Loxley
* Agnes Mere

They argue politely.
They keep receipts.
They expect the empire to function.

---

# Tier 2 — Overreach & Residue

### Philosophy:

Order becomes extractive.

This is the failed campaign zone.

The empire built:

* Forts.
* Signal towers.
* Supply depots.
* Roadworks.

Then retreated.

Now what remains is:

* Skeletonized infrastructure.
* Half-collapsed garrisons.
* Dug-in artillery pits.
* Watchfires never relit.

---

### Social Ecology

There are no towns.

Only:

* Outposts barely functioning.
* Rag-tag patrols.
* Affable scavenger bands.
* Ex-soldiers who never rejoined civilian life.

The tone is brittle.

Everyone is defensive.

Everyone believes the land still belongs to someone.

---

### Military Patrol Behavior

they still hold some forts. they are the outcome of tepid half-measures to retake the farther plains. the empire rotates out a few platoons each spring. the current crop has been hear half a year.

some are true believers who think they are the tip of the spear and will ride into glorious battle someday. or they're officers who want to make a name for themselves on the valor of their men.

most are just here doing a tour of duty. they want to stay in the fort, play card games, avoid provoking a fight, and make it home alive.

They insist:

> “You shouldn’t be here.”

But they won’t explain why.

They are:

* Embarrassed.
* Under orders.
* Still technically guarding nothing.

They resent scavengers because:

* That’s imperial property.
* Their grandfather is out here somewhere.
* The campaign wasn’t “a mistake.”

---

### Bandits

They’re not raiders.

They’re:

* Logisticians without a state.
* Families squatting in depots.
* Salvagers with territory claims.

They hate theft because:

> “That’s our scrap.”

They operate like guilds, not marauders. they don't want beef with the military. they are not heroes.

they squat in abandoned forts and outposts. the pick salvage from the battlefields and carry it back to trade.

---

### Tier 2 Naming Style

More utilitarian. Functional.

* **Fort Redbank**
* **Signal Post Eight**
* **Westward Bastion**
* **Harrow Line**
* **Grainway Station**
* **Forward Depot Three**
* **The Old Survey Road**
* **Dunfield Watch**

Bandit leaders:

* Garrick Vale
* “Old” Merrin Quade
* Tob Ashford
* Halwick Dunn
* Rourke Fenn

Military remnants:

* Captain Ivor Strake
* Sergeant Wyll Cade
* Quartermaster Renold Pike
* Lieutenant Bram Elcott

Everything sounds half-official.

---

# Tier 3 — Autonomous Order

### Philosophy:

Order without humanity.

No settlements.

No civilians.

No bandits.

No patrols.

Even the empire won’t come here.

This is not a battlefield.

It is infrastructure.

---

### The Abandoned City

This is like a mirror of Aldgate. This was someone else's city on their frontier. the machines were there to protect the civilians. the civilians are gone, but the machines are still there. they defend nothing.

Empty.

Not destroyed.

Not looted.

Just vacated.

Doors closed.

Granaries empty.
Market stalls intact.

The empire ran the numbers and left it behind. it wasn't worth the cost to go out and deactivate the defense grid.

---

### The Grid

Not chaotic.

Not malicious.

It activates based on:

* Density thresholds.
* Weapon signatures.
* Heat signatures.
* Boundary crossing.

It does not chase beyond parameters.

It enforces.

---

### Golems

They are not mythic.

They are part numbers.

Designations like:

* **STN-4H**
* **ARX-11**
* **Pylon Unit R-9**
* **Sentinel 7-C**
* **Grid Marshal L-0**
* **Obelisk Node V-12**

No nicknames.

No personality.

When encountered, their identification is spoken or inscribed in crisp utilitarian script.

They do not taunt.

They do not roar.

They announce operational states.

# Clean Tier Escalation

| Tier | Expression of Order    | Human Presence | Tone               |
| ---- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | Agriculture & contract | Dense          | Warm, structured   |
| 2    | Military expansion     | Fractured      | Defensive, brittle |
| 3    | Autonomous defense     | None           | Quiet, impersonal  |

# Biome Identity in One Sentence

**The Plains are where humanity tried to systematize safety — and discovered safety scales better than people do.**
