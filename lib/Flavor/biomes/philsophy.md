each biome has a culture and a sort of philosophical or thematic through-line.

Plains is about the left-overs from ancient conflict and how they poison the world, even after the conflict has long past.
Swamp is about loss of identity in the face of nature. The sense that we are small and insignificant.
Scrub is about capitalism, basically. About this strange force that aligns and organizes everything but remains inscrutable.
Forest is about the cost of freedom, and what true, ultimate freedom might look like.
