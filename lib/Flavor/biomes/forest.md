# The Forest

## Core Axis

**Occlusion and Authorship**

The forest is not about wildness.

It is about limited sight, hidden agency, and the uneasy sense that someone else may be shaping events just beyond your vision.

Unlike swamp (absorption), plains (exposure), or mesa (systemic order), the forest is intimate.

# Tier Structure

## Tier 1 — Working Wood

Near civilization. Managed, negotiated, imperfectly owned.

**Theme:** Boundaries and Use.

* Woodcutters, charcoal burners, trappers.
* Disputes over logging rights.
* Old shrines swallowed by bark.
* Missing game, reversed trail markers.

Fear is practical:
“You shouldn’t have gone past that bend.”

Architecture:

* Timber frames with bark still on beams.
* Moss-weighted shingles.
* Sapling fences.
* Cabins that blend into undergrowth.

Settlement Names:

* Thornrun
* Harth Glen
* Brask
* Redbark
* Skell Hollow

People:

* Bram Skell
* Edda Thorn
* Korrin Hale
* Tams Redleaf
* Soren Pike

Short names. Hard consonants. Woodcutter rhythm.

Tier 2 — The Deep Wood

Theme: Failed Belonging

This is where the outcasts gather.

Not villains.

People who could not remain.

Plateau clan sons who refused blood-feuds.

Mesa clerks who falsified the wrong ledger.

Mountain deserters.

Debtors.

Lovers who ran.

Lattice defectors who asked the wrong question.

They come from everywhere.

They are distrustful.
They are wanted.

Someone, somewhere, is looking for each of them.

They form loose camps.
No flags.
No shared banner.
Just proximity.

They trade.
They lie.
They keep watch.

Architecture:

Cabins built from scavenged beams.

Smoke carefully masked.

Hidden clearings.

False trails leading nowhere.

The forest here is refuge.

But refuge costs:

You lose reputation.
You lose protection.
You lose your name.

You gain space.

Fear here is social:

Everyone is hiding from something.
Everyone assumes you are too.

## Tier 3 — The Domain

No one goes here.

Not because of monsters.

Because it is stupid.

It is nasty with snares, deadfalls, pungee pits, friction traps.

Getting deeper is easy.

Getting out is hard.

The forest slopes subtly inward.

You cannot sleep.

You hear movement.
You check.
Nothing.

Fourteen times nothing.
What about the fifteenth?

**Theme:** Curated Experience.

There is one person.

They are not insane.
They are not frenzied.

They are disciplined.
Patient.
Competent.

A mirror of you.

You planned your load-out.
They planned your route.

You prepared for threats.
They prepared for your preparations.

You find their dwelling.

Austere. Orderly.

Tools cleaned.
Topographic sketches.
Looped path diagrams.
Annotations.

Tokens from previous hunts:

A snapped compass.
A bent insignia.
A scorched journal page.
A broken spur.

Each tagged.

Each dated.

Each described in calm handwriting.

You were not surviving.

You were progressing.

The horror is not death.

It is the realization:

There was never an outside.

You entered a narrative.
You mistook friction for chance.
Hope was permitted to crest.
Not until the perfect moment
does it extinguish.

# Cultural Through-Line

Forest folk respect routine.

They distrust maps.

They mark trees obsessively.

They say little about the deep wood.

Proverbs are short:

“Cut what you carry.”
“Paths change.”
“Don’t go where the canopy closes.”

They do not romanticize the forest.

They endure it.

---

# Visual Identity

* Tight sightlines.
* Knotted roots.
* Spiral moss growth.
* Straight trunks that feel slightly too evenly spaced.
* Sound that dies quickly.

Color palette:

* Dark loam brown
* Moss green
* Bark gray
* Dull amber light

# Philosophical Contrast

Plains — You are small.
Swamp — You are dissolving.
Mesa — You are irrelevant to the system.
Mountains — You are bound to kin and labor.
Forest — You are not the author here.

The forest is the only biome where a single human will can eclipse yours.

That is why it is scary.
