# The High Mesa Corridor

Wind-cut plateaus. Dry riverbeds. Terraced valleys. Salt flats and rail lines.

This is a frontier where kinship and administration grind against each other under an ambiguous cosmic order called **the Lattice**.

---

## Factions

### 1. Plateau Clans

Highland kin-groups controlling passes, wells, and terraced valleys.

**Core values:** honor, hospitality, autonomy
**Power base:** fortified hill villages
**Law:** oral, precedent-based
**View of the Lattice:** “city superstition” / veiled idolatry

They feud, negotiate passage, and guard ancestral land.

---

### 2. The Remnant Administration

Descendants of a fallen empire. Now civil stewards of infrastructure, rail, census, and quotas — acting “in alignment with the Lattice.”

**Core values:** order, stability, correct procedure
**Power base:** rail depots, walled administrative towns
**Law:** written codes, stamped authority
**View of the Lattice:**

* a governing principle
* the underlying pattern of reality
* not worship — alignment

They do not speak of gods.
They speak of balance, adjustment, correction.

---

## The Lattice (Ambiguous)

* “The Lattice requires adjustment.”
* “We maintain alignment.”
* “Deviation invites correction.”

Clans say they worship it.

Administrators insist it is merely a principle.

Rail routes change without explanation.

Harvest quotas shift.

Borders redraw.

No one has seen the Lattice.

## Architecture

### Plateau Clans

* Stone compounds
* Narrow windows
* Terraced farms
* Defensive hill settlements
* Wind-scoured banners

Heavy, irregular, practical.

### Remnant Administration

* Square mudbrick or pale stone towns
* Interior courtyards
* Rail platforms and signal towers
* Clean lines, geometric motifs
* Faded imperial insignia (sunburst, radial sigils)

Order imposed on dust.
