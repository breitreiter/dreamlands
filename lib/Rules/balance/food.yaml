# Food & Provisions Balance Data
#
# Philosophy: Category is the mechanic. Names are regional color.
# A protein is a protein — "smoked fish" and "salted pork" are
# functionally identical. The name is assigned at point of sale
# based on settlement biome, exactly like weapon types.
#
# Each biome has two flavor lists per category:
#   vendor  — prepared/preserved foods bought from settlements
#   foraged — raw/wild foods scavenged from the land
# No tier distinction. Mountains are mountains.
#
# Players consume 3 units of food per day during rest resolution.
# Eating one from each category (protein + carb + sweet) is a
# "balanced meal" and grants a mild bonus. You CAN eat 3 proteins
# and survive, but you miss the bonus. Running out means Hungry.

  # ─── Special Foods ──────────────────────────────────────────
  # These belong to a category (count toward the triad) but also
  # provide a weak prophylactic against a specific condition.
  # They don't cure — they slightly reduce overnight contraction
  # chance. Think garlic-and-ginger soup, not penicillin.
  #
  # More expensive than plain food. Worth packing if you know
  # where you're headed.
