  # Weapons & Armor
  # Quality is the mechanic. Class (sword, axe, club, spear, dagger, staff) determines
  # narrative text — readying sentences, damage descriptions — via weapon_classes.yaml.
  # A "crude weapon" might be a rusty seax (sword) or a heavy cudgel (club).
  # Flavor names (biome-specific) live in lib/Flavor/equipment_names.yaml.
