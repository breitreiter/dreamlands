You pause, run your palm along the surface, and note the subtle downward slope of the floor. Water seeks the depths. You follow its course.\n    The logic reveals itself in fragments. Passages that slant upward lead nowhere. Those that descend branch often, but the lowest path always continues.

Fortunes to those willing to take them; death to those who underestimate the land.\n\nYou turn the seal ring over in your fingers, feeling the weight of gold against your palm. A signet ring, worn smooth from years of use. It has stamped contracts, treaties, death sentences. It is a ring that opens doors for the bearer, loosens tongues, carries the grim authority of the Trade Guild.\n\nThe ring catches the dim light as you slide it back onto your finger. The weight still feels new and unfamiliar.\n\nHow did you come by this ring?\n",

The Harrower groans against the mooring lines and already the city\u0027s hunger announces itself: brown hands grasping for rope, dock-boys swarming the gunwale, and behind them the stevedores, sullen-eyed, appraising the hold with the cold arithmetic of men who tithe to three masters and steal from all of them.\n\nBeyond the wharves the city rises in tiers of crumbling grandeur\u2014warehouses faced in cracked marble, temples gone green with verdigris, and above all the counting-houses of the great guilds, their windows watching the harbour like the lidless eyes of old lizards. Wealth built this place. Wealth and the patient labour of corruption, which hollowed its pillars and made of its courts a labyrinth where gold moves more freely than justice.\n\nYou descend the gangplank with one sea-chest and a ring.\n\nThe ring matters more than anything in the chest. A Merchant Seal\u2014heavy, tarnished silver, stamped with the sigil of the island compact\u2014it sits on your third finger like a quiet declaration of war. With it you may trade beyond the frontier tariff lines, deal in rawstone and blackwood, keep what the guilds would otherwise devour. Without it you are meat.\n\nIt is the ring that draws the woman\u0027s gaze.\n\nShe waits at the foot of the plank where the customs men have set their folding table\u2014tall, sashed in the coat of a harbour official, her hair drawn back with a severity that matches the line of her mouth. Two pike-bearing guards flank her. She extends one hand, palm upward, with the rehearsed authority of a thousand repetitions.\n\n\u0022The Seal. Registered cargo and letters of compact. You will present them before you set foot on sovereign stone.\u0022\n\nHer eyes are on the ring. Not the chest, not your face\u2014the ring. And behind her, half-lost in the press of dockworkers and brazier smoke, a second figure watches: a lean man in no uniform at all, whose stillness amid the chaos is its own species of announcement.\n\nThe woman\u0027s fingers curl. The guards shift their weight. The lean man tilts his head, as a bird does when it has found something bright and worth taking.\n\nNo one else on the dock will meet your eye.\n",

A wheat field halfway to harvest, rolling gold and green under a pale sky, and at its heart a ribbon of flame eating its way toward the road. The fire is young yet, barely waist-high, but the grain is tinder-dry and the wind is steady. Already the smoke rises in a grey column that will be visible from the city walls. A farmer stands at the field\u0027s edge, frozen, staring at the destruction with his mouth open. His hands hang at his sides like dead things. Behind him, two children clutch each other, wide-eyed and silent.\n\nBeyond the flame, perhaps fifty paces into the field, a mule brays in panic. It is tangled in something, harness or rope, thrashing as the fire crawls closer. The farmer seems not to hear it. He is muttering numbers under his breath, calculations of loss, the arithmetic of ruin.\n\nA woman runs up from the direction of the village, breathless, carrying two empty sacks. She sees the mule and curses, low and bitter. \u0022The well\u0027s dry,\u0022 she says to no one in particular. \u0022The well\u0027s been dry since yesterday.\u0022 She looks at the field, at the smoke, at the farmer who will not move.

If his crop burns, bread prices double by week\u0027s end.\u0022\n\nThe mule screams again. The fire creeps forward, a slow bright line dividing the world into what can be saved and what is already lost. The farmer\u0027s children have started to cry. The wind does not care. It pushes the flames steadily toward the road, toward the village beyond, toward the next field and the next.\n\nThe woman holds out one of the sacks. \u0022Help or don\u0027t,\u0022 she says. \u0022But decide now.\u0022\n",

Now the trader holds it at arm\u0027s length, recounting the insult word for word to the gathering crowd. Laughter ripples through them. The courier\u0027s face has gone red, though whether from heat or humiliation is hard to say.\n\nYou catch the shift in the crowd\u0027s mood before the courier does. The laughter has an edge now. Someone mutters about arrogant lowlanders. A woman spits in the dust. The trader is still talking, working them like a merchant working a sale, and the courier keeps demanding his property back in that clipped administrative accent that makes everything sound like a reprimand. The signet ring on your hand catches light\u2014the Merchant Guild mark that means you walk between worlds, neither clan nor Kesharat but trusted by both when coin is involved. The courier sees it. His eyes fix on you like a drowning man spotting driftwood.\n\nThe trader wants an apology. The courier would sooner eat glass. And the crowd\u2014wind carries their voices across the exposed stone, a low buzz of old resentments given sudden shape. If they lay hands on him, the Kesharat will answer it. Not here, not now. But somewhere a clan will wake to soldiers at their gates, and a debt will be collected that has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with the appearance of authority. The elder under the awning hasn\u0027t moved, but his eyes are open. Watching.\n\nThe trader holds the case higher. The crowd presses closer. The courier\u0027s hand drifts toward his belt where no weapon hangs.\n\n",

Around the platform the villagers mutter, not wild with anger but steady with it \u2014 the sound of people who know when they\u0027ve been handled.\n\nThe guild merchant stands aloof, dry, immaculate, and composed. He taps the parchment with a gloved finger and explains, patiently, that the exclusivity clause extends to \u0022all navigable channels, known or later discovered,\u0022 that the yield guarantee binds the village irrespective of seasonal variance, and that the penalty for breach accrues at a rate any child could calculate. \n\nHe signs deeply, adopting a patronizing tone. \u0022You promised fish,\u0022 he says. \u0022If the western channels failed, you should have found others. The contract does not concern itself with disappointment.\u0022\n\nThe elder\u0027s mouth tightens. The advance coin paid for seed after a blight year. For timber when the flood took three homes. The villagers understood a bad season to be a shared misfortune, not an opportunity for interest to breed like midges. They have no fish in the quantities demanded. They do not have the coin the merchant now claims is owed.\n\nThe merchant closes his ledger with a soft, satisfied sound. He will accept payment in fish, in silver, or in pledged labor at guild rates. Failing that, he will mark the village delinquent and let the Guild pursue remedies less conversational. The elder turns to you, eyes sharp and measuring.\n",

Two figures pole into view behind you, maybe fifty yards back. They move with the efficient rhythm of locals, but they\u0027re watching the channels ahead, not the water beneath them. Hunting.\n\nThe woman jerks her head toward a narrow side channel choked with reeds. She could slip through there if you give her time. Or you could step aside, let the pursuers see her, let village justice sort itself. The bundle in her arms looks old. The kind of thing that has a place it belongs, and people who remember where that place is. The punt pole taps closer. The woman\u0027s knuckles are white around the knife handle.\n\nThe pursuers will reach this bend in moments. Whatever she\u0027s taken, it matters enough to chase into the fen.\n",

Black water sucking at your boots, the ceaseless drone of biting flies, air so thick with rot it coats the back of your throat like oil. The trail, such as it was, vanished yesterday beneath a carpet of duckweed. Since then you have navigated by the moss on the cypress knees and the slow pull of current beneath the water\u0027s skin, trusting that the deeper channels lead inland toward high ground and the frontier beyond.\n\nYou had not expected to find anyone living here. Nothing lives here that does not bite, sting, or drag itself through the muck on its belly.\n\nYet there it is: a smudge of smoke above the treeline, yellow-grey against the perpetual overcast, and beneath it, as you round a curtain of hanging moss, a dwelling. The world is generous. It is a shack built on stilts above the waterline, patched with bark and river-reed and what appears to be sailcloth long since gone to grey. Animal bones hang from the eaves on cords of sinew, clicking softly in a breeze you cannot feel. A dugout canoe is tethered to one stilt. On the listing porch, a cookfire burns in a ring of river stones, and over it a blackened pot sends up a steam that cuts through the swamp-stink with something almost pleasant\u2014herbs, root vegetables, something warm and human.\n\nThe woman sits beside the fire as though she has been waiting.\n\nShe is old, or perhaps merely weathered beyond reckoning; face like cracked leather, hair a white tangle threaded with feathers and what might be small bones. Her clothes are layered and shapeless, stained with mud and tannin. She watches you with eyes that are, against all expectation, perfectly clear. Pale. Amused.\n\n\u0022Sit,\u0022 she says, as though you are late to supper.\n\nShe does not rise. Does not reach for a weapon. She stirs the pot with a wooden spoon and the smell intensifies; rich, savory, undeniably good. Your stomach clenches. It has been too long since you\u0027ve had a warm meal.\n\n\u0022You\u0027ll want to eat before the water rises,\u0022 she continues, conversational, almost cheerful. \u0022Moon\u0027s pulling the fen tonight. The channels you walked this morning will be six feet deep by dark.\u0022 She taps the spoon against the pot\u0027s rim. \u0022If you know the way through, you\u0027ll manage fine. If you don\u0027t...\u0022 She shrugs, a gesture that carries the weight of absolute indifference to your survival.\n\nHer pale eyes drift to your pack, your boots, the shape of what you carry. She smiles. Three teeth are missing. The rest are very white.\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t get visitors,\u0022 she says. \u0022Not ones who last.\u0022\n\nSomething moves in the shack behind her. A scrape, a settling weight. She does not look back at it.\n",
